1 A Correction Direction is a Direction issued to a person who has communicated a falsehood (i.e. the recipient) that 
affects the public interest. It requires the recipient to publish a correction notice, providing access to the correct facts. 
The Direction does not require the recipient to take down their post or make edits to their content, and does not impose 
criminal sanctions.
