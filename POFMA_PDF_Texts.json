The platform will be required to insert a notice against the original \npost, with a link to the Government\u2019s clarification.  \n \nClarifications regarding falsehoods  \n \n3 \n On 1 September 2022, The Alternative View published a Facebook post, which \nreproduces the headline of an article from AsiaOne (dated 31 August 2022) stating \n\u201cAng Mo Kio BTO flats: Strong demand for 5-room units despite prices of up to $877k\u201d, \ncontains an image of the Minister for National Development holding a bag of money, \nand ends with the caption asking \u201cHow much profit is HDB reaping from this?\u201d.  \nImplicitly this post is stating that HDB is making profit from the sale of the Central \nWeave @ AMK Build-to-Order (BTO) flats, which are part of the August 2022 BTO \nsales exercise. This statement is false. \n \n4 \nHDB will not profit from the sale of the Central Weave @ AMK BTO flats. In \nfact, it will incur a loss from this project, as the estimated amount to be collected from \nthe sale is lower than the estimated total development cost of the project. If we take \ninto account the CPF housing grants that HDB will extend to eligible buyers, the deficit \nis higher still. \n \n5 \nThe amount HDB collects from the sale of flats in every financial year is less \nthan the costs it incurs, including the total development cost (comprising land cost and \nconstruction cost) and CPF housing grants. HDB incurs a deficit every year.  \n \n6 \nFor the Financial Year (FY) 2021/2022, HDB incurred a deficit of $3.85 billion \nin its Homeownership Programme. The average deficit incurred by HDB in the last \nthree years (FY2019/20 \u2013 FY2021/22) was about $2.68 billion per year.

Because of this, most first-\ntimer buyers use less than a quarter of their monthly income to service their housing \nloans. Close to 90% of first-timer families service their HDB loans using CPF with little \nor no cash payments.  \n \n8 \nHDB will continue to use the allocated resources judiciously to provide affordable \nand quality homes for Singaporeans.   \n \n9 \nFor the facts of the case, please refer to the Factually article \u201cCorrections \nregarding HDB\u2019s BTO programme\u201d (https://www.gov.sg/article/factually040922).  \n \n \n \n \nIssued by:  Ministry of National Development \nDate:  \n4 September 2022 \n \n \n \n",

A senior official \nfrom the Ministry of Home Affairs responded to the Nikkei Asia Article on 28 July 2021, \ngiving the facts. Nikkei Asia published the Ministry of Home Affairs\u2019 response as a \nletter to the editor (\u201cSingapore says commentary on KTV outbreak is full of \ninaccuracies\u201d) on 29 July 2021. At no point did the Singapore Government threaten to \nend Nikkei Inc.\u2019s operations in Singapore. \n \n3. \nM Ravi was suspended from practising law for five years not because he had \ncriticised the Government. He was suspended because the Court of Three Judges \nfound that his various allegations against the Attorney-General, Deputy Attorney-\nGeneral and prosecutors, and the Law Society, had recklessly and baselessly \nundermined the pillars of Singapore\u2019s legal system and would cause grave injury to \npublic confidence in the legal profession and the administration of justice in Singapore. \nFor instance, M Ravi had accused the Prosecution of being \u201coverzealous in his \nprosecution and that has led to the death sentence [in Gobi\u2019s case]\u201d. M Ravi had also \nthreatened to commence proceedings against the Law Society \u201cif it entertains any \nfurther complaints or partcipates [sic] in any harassment by AG to harass me in doing \nmy job.\u201d \n \n4. \nLee Hsien Yang and Lee Suet Fern were not forced to leave Singapore under \nthreat of Government action for warring with Lee Hsien Loong. They left Singapore \nafter the Police engaged them for an investigation. The Police had commenced \ninvestigations into Lee Hsien Yang and Lee Suet Fern for possible offences of giving \nfalse evidence in judicial proceedings, following findings by the Court of Three Judges \nand a Disciplinary Tribunal investigating charges of professional misconduct against \nLee Suet Fern, that Lee Hsien Yang and Lee Suet Fern had lied under oath.

This is untrue. \n \n5. \nOver the last two decades (excluding FY2020, which had a significant fiscal deficit due \nto COVID-19 expenditures), the Government recorded on average a fiscal balance of $2.2 \nbillion per annum.

The truth was that the Police had received a call for assistance from \na member of the public, and were rendering assistance to the elderly woman and trying \nto help her find her way home. The Police issued two clarification statements regarding \nthis incident on 19 May 2021 and 25 May 2021 (see Annex).  \n \n3. \nTOC was issued a Correction Direction on 21 May 2021 under the Protection \nfrom Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act 2019 (\u201cPOFMA\u201d) for publishing the \nfalsehoods. TOC appealed to set aside the Correction Direction, but the appeal was \ndismissed by the High Court in 2022. The High Court found that TOC had published a \nfalse statement of fact, and that the Police officers had in fact expressed concern for \nthe elderly woman, with the aim of rendering assistance to her. The Court observed \nthat the original publisher could not, in good faith, have concluded that there was \nreprimanding or taunting by the Police.  \n \n4. \nDespite the Government\u2019s clarifications and the High Court\u2019s clear findings on \nthe matter, Xu and TOCA have persisted in making false allegations pertaining to the \ncase. These allegations are wholly unfounded. They may affect public trust and \nconfidence in the Singapore Police Force.

Genetic recombination \n(that is, the exchange of genetic information) of viruses is known to occur only in \ngenetically related viruses. The HIV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses are not related, and it \nis implausible in biological terms that these viruses can undergo genetic recombination. \nTo date, there is also no scientific evidence that such a recombination between HIV \nand SARS-CoV-2 has occurred, contrary to Goh\u2019s assertion.  \n \n2 \n \n5. \nThe claim that HIV might become transmissible by droplets in the air is also \nunfounded. Viruses simply do not change drastically enough to take on vastly different \nproperties. HIV is transmitted via bodily fluids, e.g., blood, semen, or vaginal \nsecretions, and will remain to be so.  \n \n6. \nThere is simply no scientific evidence to make the claim that the Omicron \nvariant is a combination of the HIV and COVID-19 viruses. \n \n7. \nThere is no evidence to suggest that the currently available COVID-19 vaccines \nare totally useless against the Omicron variant. \n \n8. \nStudies are ongoing, and there is currently insufficient data on how the Omicron \nvariant affects vaccine effectiveness. Most scientists believe that existing vaccines will \nretain some effectiveness against the Omicron variant, but protection may be less due \nto the large number of mutations in the Omicron variant.   \n  \n9. \nFor facts of the case, please refer to the Factually article \u201cCorrections and \nClarifications on falsehoods regarding content about COVID-19 and the Omicron \nvariant \nin \na \nFacebook \npost \nby \nGoh \nMeng \nSeng\u201d \nat \nhttps://www.gov.sg/article/factually031221\u201d. \n \n10. \nThe Government takes a serious view of these falsehoods and a police report \nhas been made in relation to the video.  \n \n11. \nWe advise members of the public not to speculate and/or spread misinformation \nwhich may cause public alarm, and to refer to credible sources of information instead. \nPlease visit www.moh.gov.sg for the latest information on COVID-19 and COVID-19 \nvaccinations. \n \nMINISTRY OF HEALTH  \n3 DECEMBER 2021 \n \n \nFor media queries, please contact:  \n",

The truth was that the Police had received a call for assistance from \na member of the public, and were rendering assistance to the elderly woman and trying \nto help her find her way home. The Police issued two clarification statements regarding \nthis incident on 19 May 2021 and 25 May 2021 (see Annex).  \n \n3. \nTOC was issued a Correction Direction on 21 May 2021 under the Protection \nfrom Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act 2019 (\u201cPOFMA\u201d) for publishing the \nfalsehoods. TOC appealed to set aside the Correction Direction, but the appeal was \ndismissed by the High Court in 2022. The High Court found that TOC had published a \nfalse statement of fact, and that the Police officers had in fact expressed concern for \nthe elderly woman, with the aim of rendering assistance to her. The Court observed \nthat the original publisher could not, in good faith, have concluded that there was \nreprimanding or taunting by the Police.  \n \n4. \nDespite the Government\u2019s clarifications and the High Court\u2019s clear findings on \nthe matter, Xu and TOCA have persisted in making false allegations pertaining to the \ncase. These allegations are wholly unfounded. They may affect public trust and \nconfidence in the Singapore Police Force. Xu\u2019s attempts to rehash issues already \nconsidered by the Court, and exploit a case involving an elderly and vulnerable woman, \nare contemptible. \n \n5. \nIt bears noting that the TOCA article is one of 60 written by Xu to raise funds to \npay for the fine imposed upon him by the courts for various offences, including \ncontempt of court and POFMA offences. \n \n6. \nThe Government takes a serious view of the deliberate communication of \nmalicious falsehoods. The Minister for Home Affairs has instructed the POFMA Office \nto issue Correction Directions1 to Xu and TOCA in respect of Xu\u2019s FB Post, the TOCA \nArticle, and TOCA\u2019s Social Media Posts.

Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam will be required to carry the correction \nnotices, stating that the Facebook and LinkedIn posts contain a false statement of fact. \n \nClarifications on the False Statement \n \n3. \nAs established in the review conducted by Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean, the \nrental paid by both Ministers were at fair market value and not below market valuation. \nThere was no evidence that the Ministers were given favourable rental rates due to their \npositions.  \n \n4. \nThe rental paid by the Ministers for both 26 Ridout Road and 31 Ridout Road were \nnot less than the respective Guide Rents for the properties. A Guide Rent must be \ncalculated for all State properties available for rent and is the key mechanism through \nwhich SLA ensures that State properties are rented out at fair market value. The Guide \nRents are determined by professional valuers. These are valuers from SLA\u2019s independent \nvaluation team or valuers appointed by professional third-party Managing Agents. Valuers \nadhere to established principles and methods for valuation. In determining the Guide \nRents, the valuers take into account factors such as location, use, floor area, physical \ncondition of the property and prevailing market conditions are taken into consideration. In \ngeneral, reference is made to rentals of comparable properties.    \n \n5. \nFor 26 Ridout Road, a professional valuer from SLA determined the Guide Rent \nfor the site, including the adjacent land to the site (\u201cAdjacent Land\u201d). The SLA valuer did \nnot know the identity of the prospective tenant for 26 Ridout Road at the material time, \nand only learnt that the tenant was Minister Shanmugam after the matter was reported in \nthe media. The market practice is for the rental valuation of such residential properties to \nbe based primarily on the Gross Floor Area of the property, and the valuation of the rental \n2 \n \nin respect of 26 Ridout Road followed established market practice. The rent per unit floor \narea for 26 Ridout Road was the third highest, when compared to that of the other nine \nBlack and White bungalows in the Ridout Road Estate which were tenanted out in 2018.   \n \n6. \nAs Minister Shanmugam had stated in his interview with the Corrupt Practices \nInvestigation Bureau (CPIB) and explained in Parliament, he had not wanted to lease the \nAdjacent Land as there would be legal obligations attached to leasing it. However, SLA\u2019s \npreference was to include the Adjacent Land within the property boundary of 26 Ridout \nRoad. That would make it clear that the responsibility for maintaining the Adjacent Land \nwould fall on the tenant, as would the legal obligations, for example, the tenant would be \nresponsible for any mosquito breeding. SLA thus negotiated an agreement in which the \nAdjacent Land would be included within the property boundary, with the tenant \nresponsible for maintaining it. For completeness, Minister Shanmugam incurred the cost \nof maintaining the Adjacent Land, which would otherwise be borne by SLA. \n \nPublication of Correction Notices \n \n7. \nAs required by the Correction Direction, Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam must publish \ncorrection notices on the said posts on his Facebook page and LinkedIn account.

On 18 August 2023, Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam published posts on his Facebook page and X \n(formerly known as \u201cTwitter\u201d) page, which made several false statements of fact: \n \na) The arrests of 10 foreign nationals on 15 August 2023 for forgery and money laundering \noffences were a result of China\u2019s Foreign Minister, Wang Yi and China\u2019s pressure on \nSingapore. \n \nb) The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) probe into Minister S Iswaran and Mr \nOng Beng Seng was a result of foreign pressure. \n \nc) The rental rates paid by Minister K Shanmugam and Minister Vivian Balakrishnan for 26 \nand 31 Ridout Road, respectively, are locked in over nine years. \n \n2. The Minister for Culture, Community and Youth and Second Minister for Law Edwin Tong has \ninstructed the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) Office to \nissue a Correction Direction to Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam in respect of his posts. Mr Kenneth \nJeyaretnam will be required to carry the correction notice, stating that the Facebook and X \nposts contain false statements of fact. \n \nClarifications on the False Statements \n \n3. First, Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam\u2019s Facebook and X posts falsely stated that the arrests of 10 \nforeign nationals on 15 August 2023 for forgery and money laundering offences were a result \nof China\u2019s Foreign Minister, Wang Yi and China\u2019s pressure on Singapore. As stated in the \nPolice News Release dated 16 August 2023 (\u201cTen Foreign Nationals To Be Charged For \nOffences Including Forgery And Money Laundering With An Estimated Value Of About One \nBillion In Cash And Various Assets Seized, Frozen Or Issued With Prohibition Of Disposal \nOrders\u201d), the Police had identified the suspects through intelligence probes and extensive \ninvestigations including the analysis of Suspicious Transaction Reports. These operations and \nthe planning of the arrests had been in the works over many months. They were not at the \nbehest or because of any foreign party. No foreign parties had been informed of these cases \nbefore the arrests. \n \n4. Second, Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam made the false statement on his Facebook post that the \nCPIB probe into Minister S Iswaran and Mr Ong Beng Seng was a result of foreign pressure. \nCPIB was investigating a separate matter, and came across some information concerning \nMinister Iswaran. It then looked into the matter. CPIB\u2019s investigation into Minister Iswaran and \nMr Ong Beng Seng was not due to foreign pressure. These facts were stated publicly on \nmultiple occasions, including the Prime Minister\u2019s and Minister Chan Chun Sing\u2019s statements \n2 \n \nin Parliament on 2 August 2023, CPIB\u2019s Press Release dated 12 July 2023, the Prime \nMinister\u2019s statement dated 12 July 2023, and the Deputy Prime Minister\u2019s doorstop interview \non 12 July 2023. \n \n5. Third, Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam\u2019s Facebook post made an untrue statement that the rental \nrates paid by Minister K Shanmugam and Minister Vivian Balakrishnan for 26 and 31 Ridout \nRoad, respectively, are locked in over nine years. The rental rates paid by the Ministers for \nthe Ridout properties were not locked in over nine years. The tenancies are renewable every \ntwo/three years, and the rentals are likewise to be reviewed, based on prevailing market value. \nWhen the tenancies of the two properties were up for renewal after the initial three years, a \nrevaluation was carried out by professional valuers to peg the rentals to the prevailing market \nrate. This valuation was based on market comparables.  \n \n\u2022 \nThe property at 26 Ridout Road was renewed in June 2021, during the COVID-19 \npandemic, for three years with the rent maintained at $26,500 per month.  \n\u2022 \nThe property at 31 Ridout Road was renewed in October 2022 for three years with the \nrent increased to $20,000 per month, from $19,000 per month. \n \nThese facts were stated in publicly available materials, including the CPIB report dated 23 \nJune 2023, Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean\u2019s review report dated 26 June 2023, as \nsubsequently reiterated and explained at the 3 July 2023 Parliament sitting during the \nMinisterial Statements and subsequent clarifications.   \n \nPublication of Correction Notice \n \n6.

On 18 August 2023, Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam published posts on his Facebook page and X \n(formerly known as \u201cTwitter\u201d) page, which made several false statements of fact: \n \na) The arrests of 10 foreign nationals on 15 August 2023 for forgery and money laundering \noffences were a result of China\u2019s Foreign Minister, Wang Yi and China\u2019s pressure on \nSingapore. \n \nb) The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) probe into Minister S Iswaran and Mr \nOng Beng Seng was a result of foreign pressure. \n \nc) The rental rates paid by Minister K Shanmugam and Minister Vivian Balakrishnan for 26 \nand 31 Ridout Road, respectively, are locked in over nine years. \n \n2. The Minister for Culture, Community and Youth and Second Minister for Law Edwin Tong has \ninstructed the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) Office to \nissue a Correction Direction to Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam in respect of his posts. Mr Kenneth \nJeyaretnam will be required to carry the correction notice, stating that the Facebook and X \nposts contain false statements of fact. \n \nClarifications on the False Statements \n \n3. First, Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam\u2019s Facebook and X posts falsely stated that the arrests of 10 \nforeign nationals on 15 August 2023 for forgery and money laundering offences were a result \nof China\u2019s Foreign Minister, Wang Yi and China\u2019s pressure on Singapore. As stated in the \nPolice News Release dated 16 August 2023 (\u201cTen Foreign Nationals To Be Charged For \nOffences Including Forgery And Money Laundering With An Estimated Value Of About One \nBillion In Cash And Various Assets Seized, Frozen Or Issued With Prohibition Of Disposal \nOrders\u201d), the Police had identified the suspects through intelligence probes and extensive \ninvestigations including the analysis of Suspicious Transaction Reports. These operations and \nthe planning of the arrests had been in the works over many months. They were not at the \nbehest or because of any foreign party. No foreign parties had been informed of these cases \nbefore the arrests. \n \n4. Second, Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam made the false statement on his Facebook post that the \nCPIB probe into Minister S Iswaran and Mr Ong Beng Seng was a result of foreign pressure. \nCPIB was investigating a separate matter, and came across some information concerning \nMinister Iswaran. It then looked into the matter. CPIB\u2019s investigation into Minister Iswaran and \nMr Ong Beng Seng was not due to foreign pressure. These facts were stated publicly on \nmultiple occasions, including the Prime Minister\u2019s and Minister Chan Chun Sing\u2019s statements \n2 \n \nin Parliament on 2 August 2023, CPIB\u2019s Press Release dated 12 July 2023, the Prime \nMinister\u2019s statement dated 12 July 2023, and the Deputy Prime Minister\u2019s doorstop interview \non 12 July 2023. \n \n5. Third, Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam\u2019s Facebook post made an untrue statement that the rental \nrates paid by Minister K Shanmugam and Minister Vivian Balakrishnan for 26 and 31 Ridout \nRoad, respectively, are locked in over nine years. The rental rates paid by the Ministers for \nthe Ridout properties were not locked in over nine years. The tenancies are renewable every \ntwo/three years, and the rentals are likewise to be reviewed, based on prevailing market value. \nWhen the tenancies of the two properties were up for renewal after the initial three years, a \nrevaluation was carried out by professional valuers to peg the rentals to the prevailing market \nrate. This valuation was based on market comparables.  \n \n\u2022 \nThe property at 26 Ridout Road was renewed in June 2021, during the COVID-19 \npandemic, for three years with the rent maintained at $26,500 per month.  \n\u2022 \nThe property at 31 Ridout Road was renewed in October 2022 for three years with the \nrent increased to $20,000 per month, from $19,000 per month. \n \nThese facts were stated in publicly available materials, including the CPIB report dated 23 \nJune 2023, Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean\u2019s review report dated 26 June 2023, as \nsubsequently reiterated and explained at the 3 July 2023 Parliament sitting during the \nMinisterial Statements and subsequent clarifications.   \n \nPublication of Correction Notice \n \n6.

He was suspended because the Court of Three Judges \nfound that his various allegations against the Attorney-General, Deputy Attorney-\nGeneral and prosecutors, and the Law Society, had recklessly and baselessly \nundermined the pillars of Singapore\u2019s legal system and would cause grave injury to \npublic confidence in the legal profession and the administration of justice in Singapore. \nFor instance, M Ravi had accused the Prosecution of being \u201coverzealous in his \nprosecution and that has led to the death sentence [in Gobi\u2019s case]\u201d.

Rather, the \nChief Valuer (\u201cCV\u201d) determines the sale price, and fixes it with reference to the fair market \nvalue.  \n \n \n1 A Correction Direction is a Direction issued to a person who has communicated a falsehood (i.e., the \nrecipient) that affects the public interest. It requires the recipient to publish a correction notice, providing \naccess to the correct facts. The Direction does not require the recipient to take down their post or make \nedits to their content and does not impose criminal sanctions if the Direction is complied with. \n \nPage 2 of 3 \n \n4. \nThe CV is an independent office, whose appointment requires the President\u2019s \nconcurrence, and whose professional assessment is made without influence from the \nGovernment.  \n \n5. \nFurther, the CV determines the sale price based on established valuation principles, \ntaking into consideration relevant resale transactions on the open market, and other relevant \nfactors such as specific parameters of the site. Such valuation principles are similarly adopted \nby professional valuers in the private sector.  \n \n6. \nSecond, the post claims that the endowment and trust funds are not transparent. This \nis untrue. \n \n7. \nTop-ups to the endowment and trust funds can be found in the Revenue and \nExpenditure Estimates (i.e., the Budget book) and the Supply Bill, which are tabled to \nParliament for approval.  \n \n8. \nThe amount of top-up to each endowment and trust fund, as well as the starting and \nending-FY balance and annual outlay, can be found in the various Financial Statements \npublished by either the Government, the relevant Statutory Board appointed as the trustee / \nagent / custodian, or the Institution of a Public Character / charity. These Financial Statements \nare publicly accessible.  \n \n9. \nKey expenditure items making up the total outlay of each fund are also listed within the \nrespective Financial Statement of each fund. For example, the Statement of the GST Voucher \nFund in the Government Financial Statements breaks down the annual disbursement into the \nfour components of the GST Voucher scheme, i.e., (i) GST Voucher - Cash, (ii) GST Voucher \n- MediSave, (iii) GST Voucher - S&CC Rebate, and GST Voucher - U-Save. \n \n10. \nThird, the post claims that the reason why the Government maintains a large land bank \nof heritage properties is to keep land prices as high as possible and preferably rising rapidly, \nand that this is part of the Government\u2019s strategy of boosting the reserves. This is untrue. \n \n11. \nThe Government\u2019s approach to land management is based on Singapore\u2019s planning \nand development needs, and not to maximise land sales proceeds nor to increase the value \nof the reserves. Certain properties in Singapore are not redeveloped but conserved because \nof their heritage and/or historical value. This was explained by Minister Edwin Tong in his \nMinisterial Statement on the rentals of state properties on 3 July 2023. \n \n12. \nMr Jeyaretnam will be required to carry a correction notice, which states that the post \ncontains false statements of fact and provide a link to the Government\u2019s clarification. This will \nallow readers to read both versions and draw their own conclusions. \n \n13. \nFor facts of the case, please refer to the Factually article Corrections regarding \nfalsehoods published by Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam on 15 June 2024 at the following link: \nhttp://www.gov.sg/article/factually040724 \n \n \n### \n \nIssued by: \nMinistry of Finance \nSingapore \n4 July 2024 \n \n \n \nPage 3 of 3 \n \nAbout Ministry of Finance \nThe Ministry of Finance aims to advance the well-being and development of Singapore \nthrough Finance.

These include the \nHome Caregiving Grant, South West Community Development Council Utilities Vouchers, and \nNTUC supermarket vouchers from the People\u2019s Association, as well as cash of $300 per \nmonth from a temple. They currently receive a total of around $830 per month in cash and \nvouchers.  \n \n4. \nSince 2021, the couple have received approximately $39,000 in cash and vouchers \nfrom various public sector agencies and community partners. This included $21,000 in \nComCare assistance from May 2021 to April 2023.  \n \n5. \nThe couple currently have more than $100,000 in total in both their CPF Retirement \nAccounts. In April 2023, the woman received a lump sum CPF payout of $5,000.  \n \n \n6. \nWhen the woman was admitted to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital (NTFGH) for an \noperation on her fractured ankle from 20 to 23 June 2023, her hospital bill was about $8,580. \nAfter Government subsidies of about $6,300, MediShield Life and MediSave, her remaining \nbill amount was about $240. The woman had more than $60,000 left in her MediSave account \nafter that withdrawal. As at 12 February 2024, she has more than $60,000 in her MediSave \naccount.  \n \n7. \nAll of the woman\u2019s outpatient physiotherapy sessions at NTFGH, which cost around \n$25 per session after Government subsidies, were also fully covered by MediFund.

    "Minister Edwin Tong Instructs POFMA Office to Issue Correction Direction.pdf": "1 \n \n \n \n \nPRESS RELEASE \n \nIssuance of Correction Direction under the \nProtection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act to Kenneth Jeyaretnam  \n \n1. \nOn 27 July 2023, Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam published posts on his Facebook page \nand LinkedIn account which made an untrue statement that the Singapore Land Authority \n(SLA) charged Minister K Shanmugam and Minister Vivian Balakrishnan rent at below \nmarket value for 26 Ridout Road and 31 Ridout Road. \n \n2. \nThe Minister for Culture, Community and Youth and Second Minister for Law \nEdwin Tong has instructed for a Correction Direction, under the Protection from Online \nFalsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA), to be issued to Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam in \nrespect of his posts. Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam will be required to carry the correction \nnotices, stating that the Facebook and LinkedIn posts contain a false statement of fact. \n \nClarifications on the False Statement \n \n3. \nAs established in the review conducted by Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean, the \nrental paid by both Ministers were at fair market value and not below market valuation. \nThere was no evidence that the Ministers were given favourable rental rates due to their \npositions.  \n \n4. \nThe rental paid by the Ministers for both 26 Ridout Road and 31 Ridout Road were \nnot less than the respective Guide Rents for the properties. A Guide Rent must be \ncalculated for all State properties available for rent and is the key mechanism through \nwhich SLA ensures that State properties are rented out at fair market value. The Guide \nRents are determined by professional valuers. These are valuers from SLA\u2019s independent \nvaluation team or valuers appointed by professional third-party Managing Agents. Valuers \nadhere to established principles and methods for valuation. In determining the Guide \nRents, the valuers take into account factors such as location, use, floor area, physical \ncondition of the property and prevailing market conditions are taken into consideration. In \ngeneral, reference is made to rentals of comparable properties.    \n \n5. \nFor 26 Ridout Road, a professional valuer from SLA determined the Guide Rent \nfor the site, including the adjacent land to the site (\u201cAdjacent Land\u201d). The SLA valuer did \nnot know the identity of the prospective tenant for 26 Ridout Road at the material time, \nand only learnt that the tenant was Minister Shanmugam after the matter was reported in \nthe media. The market practice is for the rental valuation of such residential properties to \nbe based primarily on the Gross Floor Area of the property, and the valuation of the rental \n2 \n \nin respect of 26 Ridout Road followed established market practice. The rent per unit floor \narea for 26 Ridout Road was the third highest, when compared to that of the other nine \nBlack and White bungalows in the Ridout Road Estate which were tenanted out in 2018.   \n \n6. \nAs Minister Shanmugam had stated in his interview with the Corrupt Practices \nInvestigation Bureau (CPIB) and explained in Parliament, he had not wanted to lease the \nAdjacent Land as there would be legal obligations attached to leasing it. However, SLA\u2019s \npreference was to include the Adjacent Land within the property boundary of 26 Ridout \nRoad. That would make it clear that the responsibility for maintaining the Adjacent Land \nwould fall on the tenant, as would the legal obligations, for example, the tenant would be \nresponsible for any mosquito breeding. SLA thus negotiated an agreement in which the \nAdjacent Land would be included within the property boundary, with the tenant \nresponsible for maintaining it. For completeness, Minister Shanmugam incurred the cost \nof maintaining the Adjacent Land, which would otherwise be borne by SLA. \n \nPublication of Correction Notices \n \n7. \nAs required by the Correction Direction, Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam must publish \ncorrection notices on the said posts on his Facebook page and LinkedIn account. The \ncorrection notices will provide a link to the Factually article, which lays out the facts and \nclarifications \non \nthe \nmatter, \nat \nthe \nfollowing \nlink: \nhttps://www.gov.sg/article/factually020823. \n \nMINISTRY OF LAW \n02 AUGUST 2023 \n \n",

They will be required to carry a correction \nnotice alongside their posts[1]. \n \nCorrections and clarifications regarding falsehoods posted by Gilbert Goh and \nTISG \n \n2           On 19 February 2020, Goh published a Facebook post alleging that a single \nmother \u2018Lina\u2019 and her six children had been evicted from their rental flat due to rental \ndefault, and that they have been staying at her sister\u2019s house. \n \n3           On 21 February 2020, TISG published an article and Facebook post on \u2018Lina\u2019 \nreiterating the same claims, after it approached Goh to obtain more details. \n \n4           The claims listed in both articles are entirely false, for the following reasons: \n \n\u2022  First, HDB did not evict \u2018Lina\u2019 from her rental flat. \u2018Lina\u2019 was previously \nliving in a HDB rental flat with her husband and children. The family did not \nhave any overdue rent throughout the period of the last tenancy. \u2018Lina\u2019\u2019s \nhusband terminated the tenancy for the rental flat and returned the keys to \nHDB in early February 2020.    \n \n\u2022 Second, \u2018Lina\u2019 and her husband have bought a new flat from HDB, which \nhas been paid for in full. \u2018Lina\u2019 and her family have since moved into their \nnew HDB flat. \n \nAdditional Clarifications \n \n5           When HDB staff visited \u2018Lina\u2019 and her husband in their new flat on 22 February \n2020, the couple explained that it was a relative who had approached Goh for \nassistance. \n \n6           \u2018Lina\u2019 and her family have been receiving assistance, including cash, vouchers, \nsubsidies and food rations, from various government agencies and community \npartners \u2013 the Ministry of Social Development (MSF), the Ministry of Education (MOE), \nthe Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA), HDB and the Sembawang Family \nService Centre. The family also received food rations and supermarket vouchers from \ntheir local grassroots organisation. \n \n7           HDB public rental flats cater to needy Singaporean households who have no \nother housing options and no family support. HDB works closely with other agencies \nand community partners, such as Social Service Offices and Family Service Centres, \nto provide support to rental tenants.  \n \n8           The false statements reported by Goh and TISG give the impression that HDB \nhas deprived a needy family of public rental housing because of their inability to pay \nfor it.

They have been assessed to be safe and effective internationally by reputable \nhealth and scientific agencies, and in Singapore by both the Health Sciences Authority \n(HSA) and the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination (EC19V). As of 31 \nOctober 2021, the serious adverse event incidence rate reported by healthcare \nprofessionals to HSA is 0.006% of total doses administered. Thus far, no deaths have \nbeen attributed to the COVID-19 vaccines. The benefits of receiving COVID-19 \nvaccines continue to far outweigh the risks of vaccination. \n \n5. \nThe United States\u2019 Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)1  data \ndo not support the claim that COVID-19 vaccines have caused a substantially higher \nrate of serious injury and death. \n \n6. \nFirst, COVID-19 vaccines have been given to a very large proportion of the US \npopulation in 2021, while the other vaccines have been given to substantially fewer \n                                                          \n \n1 The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System is co-managed by the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention (CDC) and the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA). \n2 \n \nindividuals in any given year. Thus, it is misleading to compare the absolute number \nof reported adverse events and deaths for COVID-19 and non-COVID vaccines. \n \n7. \nSecond, there is much higher surveillance and awareness of adverse event \nreporting for COVID-19 vaccines, compared with other vaccines.  \n \n8. \nThird,  any member of the public may report adverse events and deaths to the \nVAERS system, regardless whether it is caused by vaccines or other factors. The \nreports are not required to be verified. They often lack details and sometimes contain \nerrors. No proof is required that the adverse event or death was caused by the vaccine. \nAnd adverse events need not be serious; they include mild side effects such as \nrash/cold/headaches. \n \n9. \nThe post has been written to falsely exaggerate the dangers of COVID-19 \nvaccines, and to discourage people from taking them. If people believe these \nfalsehoods, there could be serious health consequences for those who then remain \nunvaccinated. As stated earlier, the evidence so far is that serious adverse events \nhave been reported in only 0.006% of total doses administered. \n \n10. \nFor facts of the case, please refer to the Factually article \u201cCorrections and \nClarifications regarding content about COVID-19 vaccines in a blog post by Cheah Kit \nSun at https://www.gov.sg/article/factually291121\u201d. \n \n11. \nMOH advises the public not to speculate and/or spread misinformation which \nmay cause public alarm, and to refer to credible sources of information instead.

Jom will be required to carry the \ncorrection notices, stating that the article contains false statements of fact. \n \nClarifications on the False Statements \n \nCorrection Direction issued by the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth and Second \nMinister for Law  \n \n3. \nFirst, Jom made the statement that Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean did not \nrespond to questions concerning the issue of actual or apparent conflicts of interest and \npossible breach of the Code of Conduct for Ministers beyond replying that it is more \nimportant to observe the spirit rather than just the letter of the Code. The article omits \nimportant information from what Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean said in Parliament1 on 3 \nJuly 2023. \n \n                                                          \n \n1 SM Teo\u2019s Ministerial Statement is available at: https://www.pmo.gov.sg/Newsroom/Ministerial-Statement-\nby-SM-Teo-Chee-Hean-on-Ridout-Road \n \n2 \n \na) Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean had expressly clarified that he meant it was \nimportant to observe the spirit as well as the letter of the Code. Senior Minister \nTeo Chee Hean also said that Minister K Shanmugam had recused himself, and \nthis meant that he no longer had any duty in the matter. There could thus be no \npotential or actual conflict of interest.  \n \nb) Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean had explained how Minister K Shanmugam had \nremoved himself from the chain of command and decision-making process entirely \nin the case of 26 Ridout Road. \n \nc) Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean had also highlighted that the Corrupt Practices \nInvestigation Bureau (CPIB) had established, as part of its independent \ninvestigation, that no matter was raised by SLA to the Ministry of Law and hence \nto any of the Ministers during the entire rental process. \n \n4. Second, Jom made an untrue statement that SLA spent more than $1 million on the \nrenovation for 26 Ridout Road and 31 Ridout Road because the Ministers were to be \nthe tenants. The identity of the tenants had no bearing on the amount spent by SLA \non the works it carried out on 26 Ridout Road and 31 Ridout Road. The article implies \nthat this sum was unusually large, and omits important information that the works done \nby SLA were consistent with SLA\u2019s general practice, and were assessed to be \nnecessary in the circumstances, as explained by Second Minister for Law Edwin Tong \nin Parliament on 3 July 2023. \n \na) SLA invests a significant amount in maintaining conserved properties such as 26 \nRidout Road and 31 Ridout Road. A key reason for the cost is the nature of the \nconservation requirements for such properties, which are much older than the \naverage property in Singapore. Second Minister for Law Edwin Tong had spoken \nat length in Parliament about the details of these conservation requirements. While \nthe maintenance works are done in periodic cycles, SLA does them in the lead up \nto a confirmed tenancy where practical, to avoid disrupting existing tenants and to \nensure that the costs can be recovered from the prospective tenant. SLA has \npublished information showing that similar and even larger amounts have been \nspent by SLA on other Black and White bungalows in a manner consistent with \nconservation requirements. \n \nb) In the case of 26 Ridout Road and 31 Ridout Road, most of the costs incurred by \nSLA were for works that external consultants had determined to be necessary, in \nlight of the condition of the properties and to comply with the relevant conservation \nrequirements. The remaining costs were incurred as part of the usual works done \nbefore the commencement of a tenancy to ensure that the property is habitable. \n \nCorrection Direction issued by the Minister for Communications and Information  \n \n5. \nThird, Jom also made the statement that the Government caused Instagram to \ngeo-block a post by Charles Yeo. This is untrue. The Government did not issue any \ndirections or requests on this matter to Meta, Instagram\u2019s parent company, that caused \nInstagram to geo-block the post in question.  \n \n \n3 \n \n \n \nPublication of Correction Notices \n \n6. \nAs required by the Correction Directions, Jom must publish correction notices on \nthe said posts on its website and social media pages.

These materials are from unverified and dubious \nsources, and individuals who heed the advice of \u201cTruth Warriors\u201d can endanger \nthemselves and the people around them. \n \n2. \nThe Minister for Health has instructed the Protection from Online Falsehoods \nand Manipulation Act (POFMA) Office to issue a Correction Direction to the \u201cTruth \nWarriors\u201d website for these falsehoods. The website is required to publish the \ncorrection notice at the top of each webpage containing the falsehoods.  \n \n3. \nThe Government takes a serious view of the deliberate communication of these \nfalsehoods, and criminal investigations will be conducted. \n \nCorrections and clarifications on falsehoods regarding COVID-19 on \u201cTruth \nWarriors\u201d website \n \n4. \nIn particular, the website has published false claims stating that: \n \ni. \nThe most vaccinated countries have the most cases and deaths per \nmillion population and the least vaccinated countries have the fewest \ncases and deaths per million population; and  \n \nii. \nVaccines do not prevent the transmission of COVID-19. \n \n5. \nThese claims are false. As of 23 October 2021, the weight of international \nevidence shows categorically that vaccines reduce COVID-19 infection, as well as \nserious illness and mortality rates from COVID-19 infection. The latest data does not \nsupport the claim that countries with the highest vaccination rates also have the \nhighest cases/deaths per million population. While some countries with the lowest \nvaccination rates also have low reported COVID-19 deaths, this is likely due to poor \nrecord collection for both vaccinations and deaths. \n \n6. \nWhile the vaccines do not completely stop viral transmission, vaccines do \nreduce the risk of transmission. Vaccinated persons are less likely to transmit the virus \nthan unvaccinated persons. Furthermore, while the vaccine on its own does not kill the \n2 \n \nvirus, it is false to suggest that the effect of the vaccine on the immune system does \nnot lead to the killing of the virus. The vaccines cause the body to produce antibodies \nand immune cells that act against the virus and, in effect, kill it. \n  \n7. \nFor facts of the case, please refer to the Factually article \u201cCorrections and \nClarifications regarding content about COVID-19 by \u201cTruth Warriors\u201d website at \nhttps://www.gov.sg/article/factually241021\u201d. \n \nAdditional clarifications  \n \n8. \nThe website also claimed that ivermectin prevents COVID-19 infection, and that \nit is safe and effective in treating COVID-19, even for pregnant women. MOH and \nHealth Sciences Authority (HSA) are aware that there are members of the public trying \nto import or use ivermectin for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. Ivermectin is \na prescription-only medicine registered in Singapore specifically for the treatment of \nparasitic worm infections. It is not an anti-viral medicine and is not approved by HSA \nfor preventing or treating COVID-19.  \n \n9. \nSelf-medicating with ivermectin can be dangerous to one\u2019s health. Side-effects \nassociated with ivermectin include vomiting, diarrhoea, stomach pain, neurologic \nadverse events (dizziness, seizures, confusion), sudden drop in blood pressure, \nsevere skin rash potentially requiring hospitalisation, and liver injury (hepatitis). \nIvermectin can also interact with other medications used, such as blood thinners. \n \n10. \nHSA takes a serious view against those engaged in the illegal sale and supply \nof medicines, including ivermectin, and will take strong enforcement action against \nsuch persons. Anyone convicted of the illegal sale of these medicines faces a penalty \nfine of up to $50,000 and/or imprisonment for a period of up to two years under the \nHealth Products Act. \n \n11. \nThe website also shares user-collated and unverified data on suspected \nvaccine injuries in Singapore, citing the \u201cSG Suspected Vaccine Injuries\u201d Telegram \nchat as its source. We advise members of the public not to speculate and/or spread \nmisinformation which may cause public alarm, and to refer to credible sources of \ninformation instead. \n \n12. \nPlease visit www.moh.gov.sg  for the latest information on COVID-19 and \nCOVID-19 vaccinations.

The information in the \nvideo is false.  \n \n2. \nThe Minister for Transport has instructed the POFMA Office to issue a \nCorrection Direction (CD) to Singapore Incidents in relation to its Facebook and \nInstagram posts on 5 May 2021, both of which contained the video.

Second, in the video, passengers were seen walking past a renovation \nhoarding at gate hold rooms D42/43 in Terminal 1. This hoarding was \nremoved on 5 April 2021, establishing that the video was taken before 5 \nApril 2021. \n \nAdditional Clarifications \n \n5. \nFrom 23 April 2021, 23:59 hrs, all long-term visit pass holders and short-term \nvisitors with recent travel history to India are not allowed entry into or transit through \nSingapore. With effect from 1 May 2021, 23:59 hrs, this border control measure was \nextended to all long-term visit pass holders and short-term visitors with recent travel \nhistory to Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. \n \n6. \nWhile there are still passenger flights arriving in Singapore from South Asia, \nthese flights carry primarily returning Singapore citizens and Permanent Residents, \ncargo, or fly in empty to pick up passengers in Singapore who are returning to South \nAsia.

These allegations are entirely unfounded. \n \n4. \nNo effort is spared to ensure that all judicial executions in Singapore are carried \nout in strict compliance with the law. All judicial executions are conducted in the \npresence of the Superintendent of the Prison and a medical doctor, among others. \nThe law also requires a Coroner (who is a Judicial Officer of the State Courts) to \nconduct an inquiry within 24 hours of the execution to satisfy himself that the execution \nwas carried out duly and properly. For the record, the rope used for judicial executions \nPage 2 of 2 \n \n \nhas never broken before, and prison officers certainly do not receive any \u201cspecial \ntraining to carry out the brutal execution method\u201d as alleged. Any acts such as those \ndescribed in the LFL statement would have been thoroughly investigated and dealt \nwith.  \n \n5. \nThese scurrilous allegations of misconduct follow a series of sensational and \nuntrue stories previously published by LFL. LFL has been publishing various \nfalsehoods to seek attention in hopes of getting Malaysian prisoners, who have been \nconvicted of drug trafficking and sentenced to death in Singapore, off the death \npenalty. \n \n6. \nThose who traffic drugs in Singapore, harm and destroy the lives of countless \nSingaporeans. These traffickers must be prepared to face the consequences of their \nactions. \n \nIssuance of Correction Direction under the Protection from Online Falsehoods and \nManipulation Act (\u201cPOFMA\u201d) \n \n7. \nRegrettably, there are some individuals and groups in Singapore who are \nspreading LFL\u2019s latest allegations. These include individuals like Kirsten Han, and \nonline pages like The Online Citizen (TOC). Yahoo Singapore has also shared an \narticle containing these allegations by its Malaysian counterpart on its Facebook page.  \n \n8. \nAccordingly, the Minister for Home Affairs has instructed the POFMA Office to \nissue a Correction Direction against LFL\u2019s statement on its website, Kirsten Han\u2019s \nFacebook post that shared LFL\u2019s statement, TOC\u2019s online article that contained the \nfalsehoods and Yahoo Singapore\u2019s Facebook post which shared an article that \ncontained the falsehoods.

Both parties will be required to insert \na notice against their original posts or articles, with a link to the Government\u2019s \nclarification.  \n \nClarifications regarding falsehoods  \n \n3 \nOn 4 Oct 2022, Yeoh published two Facebook posts referring to the reply made \nby the Minister for National Development to Mr Leong Mun Wai\u2019s Parliamentary \nQuestion. The Online Citizen (TOC) subsequently carried an article on the same day \nechoing the points raised in Yeoh\u2019s Facebook posts.  \n4 \nYeoh\u2019s Facebook posts falsely convey the following:  \na. HDB will not incur a loss of about $270 million from the Central Weave @ \nAMK Build-To-Order (BTO) Project; and \nb. The Government is free to sell State land at nominal or much lower cost \nthan its fair market value. \n \n5 \nOn 5 Oct 2022, TOC published a second article headlined \u201cSingapore\u2019s \nreserves substantially profits from $500m land sales in AMK BTO\u201d. The article claimed \nthat Minister (ND)\u2019s reply alluded to \u201cprofits being made from the land sale by the \ngovernment\u201d and that \u201csuch profits would go to the reserves\u201d. The headline falsely \nconveys that the Government\u2019s sale of land to HDB for the AMK BTO project will lead \nto an increase in Singapore\u2019s reserves. \n \n \n \n1 A Correction Direction is a Direction issued to a person who has communicated a falsehood (i.e. the recipient) \nthat affects the public interest. It requires the recipient to publish a correction notice, providing access to the correct \nfacts. The Direction does not require the recipient to take down their post or make edits to their content and does \nnot impose criminal sanctions.  \nFOR IMMEDIATE REPORTING \nPage 2 of 3 \n \n6 \nThe losses incurred by HDB, as stated by Minister (ND) in Parliament, are \naccurate and real. \na. For the Central Weave @ AMK project, HDB will incur an estimated \ndevelopment loss of about $250 million, or about $270 million after taking \ninto account housing grants.   \nb. HDB\u2019s deficits are covered using funding from the annual Budget, which is \nraised from taxes and other revenue streams.  \nc. Real money is involved, and this is certainly not an \u201caccounting sleight of \nhand\u201d. \n \n7 \nState Land is part of the Past Reserves. It is not part of the assets that the \nGovernment can use as it wishes. When HDB requires land to develop flats, the land \nhas to be taken out of the Past Reserves. HDB has to purchase the land by paying \nfair market value for the land, and the money goes into the Past Reserves. The \nestimated land cost for Central Weave @ AMK is about $500 million. \n \n8 \nThe Government cannot sell State land at nominal or much lower cost than its \nfair market value without the President\u2019s approval, as doing so would constitute a draw \non Past Reserves. \na. Past Reserves are protected by the Constitution for the benefit of current \nand future generations. The President\u2019s concurrence is needed before the \nGovernment can draw on Past Reserves. \nb. Past Reserves are invested, and the Government can use part of the \ninvestment income to meet Singapore\u2019s needs. This income is currently our \nbiggest single source of revenue, exceeding the revenue from personal \nincome taxes, corporate income taxes, or GST. Past Reserves are also an \nemergency fund for use during crises, for example in managing the impact \nof the COVID-19 pandemic. \nc. If the Government arbitrarily prices the land below its fair market value, such \nas at the historical price that past Governments had paid to acquire the land, \nor at just a nominal $1, then it is not putting back fully what it has taken out \nfrom Past Reserves. This is equivalent to drawing down the Reserves and \nshort-changing future generations, depriving them of their nest-egg.  \nd. To consume Past Reserves at the expense of Singapore\u2019s future \ngenerations and security is populist and irresponsible. Our Constitution is \ndesigned to try to stop any Government from this kind of behaviour. \n \n9 \nThere is an established process to determine the fair market value of land. \na. The Chief Valuer, a public officer whose appointment requires the \nPresident\u2019s concurrence, determines independently the fair market value \nusing well-accepted and established valuation principles. \nb. These are the same valuation principles adopted by professional valuers in \nthe private sector.  \nc. The current fair market value of land is not the same as the historical cost \nincurred to acquire the land, as the market value of land is influenced by \nfactors such as the current planned land use. \nFOR IMMEDIATE REPORTING \nPage 3 of 3 \n \n \n10 \nNeither the Government nor the Past Reserves profit from land sales. When \nState land is disposed of at fair market value, there is no addition to the Past Reserves \nbut a conversion of one type of asset (land) to another (cash). For the Central Weave \n@ AMK BTO project, HDB will pay the Government fair market value for the land, \nestimated to be about $500 million. This money will be paid into the Past Reserves, \nbut does not result in a net increase in the Past Reserves. \n \nDelivering good, affordable homes for Singaporeans  \n \n11 \nHDB does not price new flats to recover the cost of land and construction. \nInstead, it prices flats significantly below market value using generous subsidies to \nensure that they are affordable to Singaporeans. \na. We can see this from resale transactions, where many flat-owners sell their \nflats on the open market at prices higher than those of comparable BTO \nflats.  \nb. HDB also provides housing grants to help specific groups of buyers with \ntheir first flat purchase.  \nc. With generous subsidies and housing grants, most first-timer households \nuse less than a quarter of their monthly income to service their HDB loans. \n \n12 \nHDB will continue to use its allocated resources judiciously to provide good, \naffordable homes for Singaporeans. \n \n13 \nFor the facts of the case, please refer to the Factually article \u201cCorrections \nregarding \nHDB\u2019s \ndeficits \nand \nSingapore\u2019s \nPast \nReserves\u201d \n(https://www.gov.sg/article/141022-b).  \n \n \nIssued by:  Ministry of National Development \nDate:  \n14 October 2022 \n",

The post contains false statements of fact.  \n \n2.  \nThis is the eighth Correction Direction that has been issued to Mr Jeyaretnam for 21 \nonline posts. Mr Jeyaretnam\u2019s website, The Ricebowl Singapore, and his accounts on \nFacebook, Instagram, X, and LinkedIn have also been declared as \u201cDeclared Online Locations\u201d \nunder POFMA, with effect from 12 December 2023, for carrying three or more different false \nstatements of fact that were subject to active POFMA directions at the material time.  \n3.  \nNotwithstanding these actions, Mr Jeyaretnam has continued to make false and \nmisleading statements about Government policies and the operations of public agencies, \ndespite publicly available facts and having the falsehoods and their corresponding facts \npointed out to him. He has repeatedly made false statements, even when the facts are clear \nand should be known to him.  \n4.  \nPOFMA Office and the Singapore Police Force commenced investigations against Mr \nJeyaretnam for possible offences under POFMA and the Administration of Justice (Protection) \nAct 2016, respectively. Agencies have been in communication with Mr Jeyaretnam since April \n2024 and have invited him to assist with the investigations. He has thus far remained out of \njurisdiction and not made himself available to assist in investigations by attending any \ninterviews.   \n \nClarifications regarding falsehoods \n \n2. \nFirst, the post claims that the Government intentionally sets artificially high land prices, \nfor sale to HDB. This is untrue. \n \n3. \nThe prices for sale of state land to HDB are not set by the Government. Rather, the \nChief Valuer (\u201cCV\u201d) determines the sale price, and fixes it with reference to the fair market \nvalue.  \n \n \n1 A Correction Direction is a Direction issued to a person who has communicated a falsehood (i.e., the \nrecipient) that affects the public interest. It requires the recipient to publish a correction notice, providing \naccess to the correct facts. The Direction does not require the recipient to take down their post or make \nedits to their content and does not impose criminal sanctions if the Direction is complied with. \n \nPage 2 of 3 \n \n4. \nThe CV is an independent office, whose appointment requires the President\u2019s \nconcurrence, and whose professional assessment is made without influence from the \nGovernment.  \n \n5. \nFurther, the CV determines the sale price based on established valuation principles, \ntaking into consideration relevant resale transactions on the open market, and other relevant \nfactors such as specific parameters of the site. Such valuation principles are similarly adopted \nby professional valuers in the private sector.  \n \n6. \nSecond, the post claims that the endowment and trust funds are not transparent. This \nis untrue. \n \n7. \nTop-ups to the endowment and trust funds can be found in the Revenue and \nExpenditure Estimates (i.e., the Budget book) and the Supply Bill, which are tabled to \nParliament for approval.  \n \n8. \nThe amount of top-up to each endowment and trust fund, as well as the starting and \nending-FY balance and annual outlay, can be found in the various Financial Statements \npublished by either the Government, the relevant Statutory Board appointed as the trustee / \nagent / custodian, or the Institution of a Public Character / charity. These Financial Statements \nare publicly accessible.  \n \n9. \nKey expenditure items making up the total outlay of each fund are also listed within the \nrespective Financial Statement of each fund. For example, the Statement of the GST Voucher \nFund in the Government Financial Statements breaks down the annual disbursement into the \nfour components of the GST Voucher scheme, i.e., (i) GST Voucher - Cash, (ii) GST Voucher \n- MediSave, (iii) GST Voucher - S&CC Rebate, and GST Voucher - U-Save. \n \n10. \nThird, the post claims that the reason why the Government maintains a large land bank \nof heritage properties is to keep land prices as high as possible and preferably rising rapidly, \nand that this is part of the Government\u2019s strategy of boosting the reserves. This is untrue. \n \n11. \nThe Government\u2019s approach to land management is based on Singapore\u2019s planning \nand development needs, and not to maximise land sales proceeds nor to increase the value \nof the reserves. Certain properties in Singapore are not redeveloped but conserved because \nof their heritage and/or historical value. This was explained by Minister Edwin Tong in his \nMinisterial Statement on the rentals of state properties on 3 July 2023. \n \n12. \nMr Jeyaretnam will be required to carry a correction notice, which states that the post \ncontains false statements of fact and provide a link to the Government\u2019s clarification. This will \nallow readers to read both versions and draw their own conclusions. \n \n13. \nFor facts of the case, please refer to the Factually article Corrections regarding \nfalsehoods published by Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam on 15 June 2024 at the following link: \nhttp://www.gov.sg/article/factually040724 \n \n \n### \n \nIssued by: \nMinistry of Finance \nSingapore \n4 July 2024 \n \n \n \nPage 3 of 3 \n \nAbout Ministry of Finance \nThe Ministry of Finance aims to advance the well-being and development of Singapore \nthrough Finance.

    "Minister Edwin Tong Instructs POFMA Office To Issue Correction Direction 25 July 2023.pdf": "1 \n \n  \n \nPRESS RELEASE \n \nIssuance of Correction Direction under the \nProtection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act to Lee Hsien Yang \n \n1. \nOn 23 July 2023, Mr Lee Hsien Yang published a post on his Facebook page, \nwhich made untrue statements that: \n \na) The State paid for the renovations to 26 Ridout Road and 31 Ridout Road because \nthe properties were leased by Ministers K Shanmugam and Vivian Balakrishnan.  \n \nb) Trees at 26 Ridout Road and 31 Ridout Road were allowed to be felled because \nthe properties were leased by Ministers Shanmugam and Balakrishnan. \n \nc) SPH Media Trust fraudulently inflated its circulation numbers. \n \n2. \nThe Minister for Culture, Community and Youth and Second Minister for Law \nEdwin Tong has instructed for a Correction Direction, under the Protection from Online \nFalsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA), to be issued to Mr Lee Hsien Yang. Mr Lee \nHsien Yang will be required to carry the correction notice, stating that the Facebook post \ncontains false statements of fact. \n \nClarifications on the False Statements \n \n3. Firstly, Mr Lee Hsien Yang made an untrue statement that the State paid for the \nrenovations to 26 Ridout Road and 31 Ridout Road because the properties were \nleased by Ministers Shanmugam and Balakrishnan. The identity of the tenants had no \nbearing on the decision on the works to be carried out on the properties. The post \nomits important information that the works done were in keeping with the Singapore \nLand Authority\u2019s (SLA) practice, and were assessed to be necessary in the \ncircumstances, as explained by Second Minister for Law Edwin Tong in Parliament on \n3 July 2023.  \n \na) SLA invests a significant amount in maintaining conserved properties, which \ninclude 26 Ridout Road and 31 Ridout Road. SLA has spent similar, or even larger, \namounts on other Black and White bungalows, consistent with conservation \nrequirements (see Factually article in paragraph 6). \n \nb) Most of the costs incurred for 26 Ridout Road and 31 Ridout Road were for works \nthat external consultants had determined to be necessary, in light of the condition \nof the properties and to comply with the relevant conservation requirements. The \nremaining costs were incurred as part of the usual works done before the \ncommencement of a tenancy to ensure that the property is habitable.  \n \n2 \n \n4. Secondly, Mr Lee Hsien Yang made the statement that the trees at 26 Ridout Road \nand 31 Ridout Road were allowed to be felled because the properties were leased by \nMinisters Shanmugam and Balakrishnan. This is untrue. The identity of the tenants \nhad no bearing on the felling of the trees at the properties. All decisions to fell trees \nwith a girth size of more than one metre were made following inspections by \nindependent arborists, and safety issues were identified. Where approval was \nrequired for any trees to be felled, such approval was obtained from the National Parks \nBoard (NParks). The reasons for the felling of the trees at both properties have been \nexplained by the Second Minister for Law Edwin Tong in Parliament on 3 July 2023.  \n \n5. Thirdly, Mr Lee Hsien Yang also made the statement that SPH Media Trust \nfraudulently inflated its circulation numbers. This is untrue. The overstatement of \ncirculation numbers happened when the media business was under SPH Limited \u2013 a \nlisted company. This was before SPH Media Trust was incorporated. When SPH \nMedia Trust took over SPH Limited\u2019s media business, it discovered, reported, and \ninvestigated the circulation issue. The Government\u2019s funding agreement to build up \npublic service media capabilities was signed with SPH Media Trust, and not SPH \nLimited. The funding quantum was based on SPH Media Trust\u2019s transformation needs, \nand not the circulation numbers. \n \nPublication of Correction Notice \n \n6. As required by the Correction Direction, Mr Lee Hsien Yang must publish correction \nnotice on the said post on his Facebook page. The correction notice will provide a link \nto the Factually article, which lays out the facts and clarifications on the matter, at the \nfollowing link: https://www.gov.sg/article/factually250723.  \n \n \n \nMINISTRY OF LAW \n25 JULY 2023 \n",

That the three women were prosecuted for organising support for the Palestinian \npeople in the ongoing Gaza war, in the form of a procession to the Istana; and \n \nb. That the Government, and in particular Minister K Shanmugam, prosecuted the \nthree women because they had expressed views that the Government did not \nagree with. \n \nFacts  \n \n3. \nThe three women were charged for an offence under Section 15(1) of the Public Order \nAct 2009 (\u201cPOA\u201d), for organising a procession in a prohibited area designated under Section \n12 of the POA and the Public Order (Prohibited Areas) Order (i.e. in the vicinity of the Istana). \nThe SDP\u2019s posts falsely suggested that the three women were instead charged for \norganising support for the Palestinian people.  \n \n4. \nThe decision to charge the three women was not in response to the views they had \nexpressed, nor depended on whether these views concorded or did not concord with the \nGovernment\u2019s views. The charges concern the organising of the unauthorised procession, \nin and of itself. Second, the decision to charge the three women was not made by Minister \nK Shanmugam, as the SDP posts had suggested. The decision to charge the three women \nwas made by the Attorney-General\u2019s Chambers, after its review of the Police\u2019s investigative \nfindings. The Minister does not make decisions relating to criminal prosecutions.  \n \n5. \nMHA would like to reiterate that the three women were charged for offences under the \nPOA, for their alleged involvement in organising a procession in the vicinity of the Istana, \nwhich is a designated prohibited area. Any person who organises a public assembly or a \nprocession in a designated prohibited area would have committed an offence, regardless of \nthe cause or issue he or she is advocating for. Prohibited areas are security sensitive areas, \nand also include the Parliament House and the Supreme Court. \n \n6. \nThese laws exist to maintain the public peace and order which Singaporeans enjoy \ntoday. We only need to look overseas at the countries which allow public protests and \ndemonstrations, to understand the disruption to daily lives, not to mention damage to \nproperties and hurt to bystanders and participants, that can result.   \n \n7. \nWe know that some Singaporeans feel strongly about the Israel-Hamas conflict, in \nsupport of both sides of the conflict. The very large majority of these views have been \nexpressed in lawful ways, online and also during the many forums and dialogues that have \nbeen organised by the authorities and other entities, as well as through support for donation \ndrives. The Government did not take any action against them, whether or not the views \nconcorded with the Government\u2019s position on the conflict. On the other hand, unauthorised \npublic processions could result in public order, and safety and security concerns, and will \nnot be allowed regardless of the cause, or which side the support is for. \n \n8. \nWe would like to urge members of the public not to engage in activities that will damage \nthe peace, public order and social harmony which Singaporeans have worked hard to \nachieve, and enjoy today. We should not deliberately break the law, even if to make a point. \nIf we do so, eventually, we will become a lawless, unstable, and disorderly society.  \n \n9. \nThe Government takes a serious view of the deliberate communication of falsehoods. \nThe Minister for Home Affairs has instructed the POFMA Office to issue a Correction \nDirection1 to the SDP; and for a Targeted Correction Direction2 to be issued to TikTok Pte \nLtd.

The Multi-Ministry Taskforce, led by the Ministers \nand staffed by senior public officials and medical professionals, was set up in January \n2020 to direct the national whole-of-government response to COVID-19 and to ensure \nsmooth coordination across Ministries and all affected sectors. The medical \nmanagement of migrant workers was guided by the Ministry of Health (MOH) and its \nmedical professionals, based on the prevailing scientific evidence and local situation.   \n  \n5 \nOn 8 February 2020, Changi General Hospital (CGH) informed MOH that an \nemployer in the construction industry was sending all his workers to the CGH A&E \nDepartment to be tested for COVID-19 though the workers exhibited no symptoms \nand were well. They were also asking for memos from the hospital to certify that the \nworkers were not infected with COVID-19 and were fit to work. The hospital was \nconcerned that this would trigger a flood of healthy workers being sent to A&E \ndepartments, distracting them from the care and treatment of ill patients who required \ntheir attention. On 12 February 2020, MOH, MOM and other agencies jointly issued \nan advisory to the industry to advise that there was no need to prevent workers who \nwere residing in the dormitory from working if they were not unwell.  \n \n6 \nSubsequently, the hospitals informed MOH that employers were still sending \nworkers who were healthy for testing. MOH then informed MOM, and a further advisory \nwas sent out on 19 February 2020 to advise employers not to send their workers who \nwere healthy for testing, so as to ensure that medical facilities and resources were \nfocused on unwell individuals who needed medical treatment. This advice was based \non the prevailing scientific evidence at that time and was also in line with MOH\u2019s risk-\nbased approach to prioritise testing and care for those who were of high risk. \n \n7 \nIn the advisories to employers, MOM did not say that employers could not bring \ntheir workers for testing.  Neither did MOM actively discourage the testing of workers. \nWhat MOM said was: \u201cDo not send workers to hospitals unless it is a medical \nemergency. If the worker is unwell, employers should send him to a general \npractitioner to seek medical attention, who will make a proper assessment on whether \nthe worker needs to be sent to the hospital.\u201d \n \n8  \nThe same advice was given to all in Singapore, citizens as well as residents: If \nunwell, even with mild respiratory symptoms, see a general practitioner immediately, \nwho will decide on the course of treatment.  \n \n9 \nThe Multi-Ministry Taskforce and government agencies will continue to take \nproactive measures to ensure the well-being of our migrant workers and safeguard the \nhealth of the general public. \n \nFor more information \n \n10 \nFor details on the corrections and clarifications regarding the misleading false \nstatements of facts, please refer to www.gov.sg/article/factually050720a \n",

The courts did not ascertain whether Tangaraju \nhad any objection to Steven Chong JCA hearing matters relating to Tangaraju\u2019s \ncase. \n \n\uf0b7 Tangaraju was convicted, and sentenced to hang, and later found to be not \nguilty. \n \n\uf0b7 Several personal costs orders were made against M Ravi without justifiable \nbasis, to penalise him for his work in death penalty cases. \n  \nFacts \n \n3. \nTangaraju, a 46-year old Singaporean, was convicted of abetting the trafficking \nof 1017.9 grammes of cannabis. The Misuse of Drugs Act provides for the death \npenalty if the amount of cannabis is more than 500 grammes. 1017.9 grammes is more \nthan twice the capital threshold, and sufficient to feed the addiction of about 150 \nabusers for a week.  \n \n4. \nTangaraju\u2019s allegation that he requested for but was denied an interpreter \nduring the recording of his statement is false, and was rejected by the High Court. The \nHigh Court found this bare allegation, raised for the first time during Tangaraju\u2019s cross-\nexamination, to be disingenuous given Tangaraju\u2019s admission that he had made no \nsuch request for any of the other statements subsequently recorded from him.  \n \n5. \nTangaraju was accorded full due process under the law. He was represented \nby legal counsel and had access to an interpreter throughout his trial.  \n \n6. \nTangaraju\u2019s then counsel was informed, before the appeal was heard, that \nSteven Chong JCA was the Attorney-General when decisions were taken in respect \nof his case. Steven Chong JCA was not, however, involved in the decision-making \nprocess, and Tangaraju\u2019s then counsel was informed of this as well. Tangaraju\u2019s then \ncounsel had replied to confirm that Tangaraju had no objections to Steven Chong JCA \nbeing a member of the coram for the Court of Appeal, to hear his appeal. \n \n7. \nTangaraju\u2019s conviction by the High Court was upheld by the Court of Appeal, \nwhich is the apex court in Singapore.  His conviction has not been overturned.  \n \n8. \nCosts orders were made against M Ravi for justifiable reasons and in \naccordance with the law, as can be found in the court judgments, which are publicly \navailable.

As of 23 October 2021, the weight of international \nevidence shows categorically that vaccines reduce COVID-19 infection, as well as \nserious illness and mortality rates from COVID-19 infection. The latest data does not \nsupport the claim that countries with the highest vaccination rates also have the \nhighest cases/deaths per million population. While some countries with the lowest \nvaccination rates also have low reported COVID-19 deaths, this is likely due to poor \nrecord collection for both vaccinations and deaths. \n \n6. \nWhile the vaccines do not completely stop viral transmission, vaccines do \nreduce the risk of transmission. Vaccinated persons are less likely to transmit the virus \nthan unvaccinated persons. Furthermore, while the vaccine on its own does not kill the \n2 \n \nvirus, it is false to suggest that the effect of the vaccine on the immune system does \nnot lead to the killing of the virus. The vaccines cause the body to produce antibodies \nand immune cells that act against the virus and, in effect, kill it. \n  \n7. \nFor facts of the case, please refer to the Factually article \u201cCorrections and \nClarifications regarding content about COVID-19 by \u201cTruth Warriors\u201d website at \nhttps://www.gov.sg/article/factually241021\u201d. \n \nAdditional clarifications  \n \n8. \nThe website also claimed that ivermectin prevents COVID-19 infection, and that \nit is safe and effective in treating COVID-19, even for pregnant women. MOH and \nHealth Sciences Authority (HSA) are aware that there are members of the public trying \nto import or use ivermectin for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. Ivermectin is \na prescription-only medicine registered in Singapore specifically for the treatment of \nparasitic worm infections. It is not an anti-viral medicine and is not approved by HSA \nfor preventing or treating COVID-19.  \n \n9. \nSelf-medicating with ivermectin can be dangerous to one\u2019s health. Side-effects \nassociated with ivermectin include vomiting, diarrhoea, stomach pain, neurologic \nadverse events (dizziness, seizures, confusion), sudden drop in blood pressure, \nsevere skin rash potentially requiring hospitalisation, and liver injury (hepatitis). \nIvermectin can also interact with other medications used, such as blood thinners. \n \n10. \nHSA takes a serious view against those engaged in the illegal sale and supply \nof medicines, including ivermectin, and will take strong enforcement action against \nsuch persons.

The benefits of receiving COVID-19 \nvaccines continue to far outweigh the risks of vaccination. \n \n5. \nThe United States\u2019 Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)1  data \ndo not support the claim that COVID-19 vaccines have caused a substantially higher \nrate of serious injury and death. \n \n6. \nFirst, COVID-19 vaccines have been given to a very large proportion of the US \npopulation in 2021, while the other vaccines have been given to substantially fewer \n                                                          \n \n1 The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System is co-managed by the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention (CDC) and the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA). \n2 \n \nindividuals in any given year. Thus, it is misleading to compare the absolute number \nof reported adverse events and deaths for COVID-19 and non-COVID vaccines. \n \n7. \nSecond, there is much higher surveillance and awareness of adverse event \nreporting for COVID-19 vaccines, compared with other vaccines.  \n \n8. \nThird,  any member of the public may report adverse events and deaths to the \nVAERS system, regardless whether it is caused by vaccines or other factors. The \nreports are not required to be verified. They often lack details and sometimes contain \nerrors. No proof is required that the adverse event or death was caused by the vaccine. \nAnd adverse events need not be serious; they include mild side effects such as \nrash/cold/headaches. \n \n9. \nThe post has been written to falsely exaggerate the dangers of COVID-19 \nvaccines, and to discourage people from taking them. If people believe these \nfalsehoods, there could be serious health consequences for those who then remain \nunvaccinated. As stated earlier, the evidence so far is that serious adverse events \nhave been reported in only 0.006% of total doses administered. \n \n10. \nFor facts of the case, please refer to the Factually article \u201cCorrections and \nClarifications regarding content about COVID-19 vaccines in a blog post by Cheah Kit \nSun at https://www.gov.sg/article/factually291121\u201d. \n \n11. \nMOH advises the public not to speculate and/or spread misinformation which \nmay cause public alarm, and to refer to credible sources of information instead.

That the three women were prosecuted for organising support for the Palestinian \npeople in the ongoing Gaza war, in the form of a procession to the Istana; and \n \nb. That the Government, and in particular Minister K Shanmugam, prosecuted the \nthree women because they had expressed views that the Government did not \nagree with. \n \nFacts  \n \n3. \nThe three women were charged for an offence under Section 15(1) of the Public Order \nAct 2009 (\u201cPOA\u201d), for organising a procession in a prohibited area designated under Section \n12 of the POA and the Public Order (Prohibited Areas) Order (i.e. in the vicinity of the Istana). \nThe SDP\u2019s posts falsely suggested that the three women were instead charged for \norganising support for the Palestinian people.  \n \n4. \nThe decision to charge the three women was not in response to the views they had \nexpressed, nor depended on whether these views concorded or did not concord with the \nGovernment\u2019s views. The charges concern the organising of the unauthorised procession, \nin and of itself. Second, the decision to charge the three women was not made by Minister \nK Shanmugam, as the SDP posts had suggested. The decision to charge the three women \nwas made by the Attorney-General\u2019s Chambers, after its review of the Police\u2019s investigative \nfindings. The Minister does not make decisions relating to criminal prosecutions.  \n \n5. \nMHA would like to reiterate that the three women were charged for offences under the \nPOA, for their alleged involvement in organising a procession in the vicinity of the Istana, \nwhich is a designated prohibited area. Any person who organises a public assembly or a \nprocession in a designated prohibited area would have committed an offence, regardless of \nthe cause or issue he or she is advocating for. Prohibited areas are security sensitive areas, \nand also include the Parliament House and the Supreme Court. \n \n6. \nThese laws exist to maintain the public peace and order which Singaporeans enjoy \ntoday. We only need to look overseas at the countries which allow public protests and \ndemonstrations, to understand the disruption to daily lives, not to mention damage to \nproperties and hurt to bystanders and participants, that can result.   \n \n7. \nWe know that some Singaporeans feel strongly about the Israel-Hamas conflict, in \nsupport of both sides of the conflict. The very large majority of these views have been \nexpressed in lawful ways, online and also during the many forums and dialogues that have \nbeen organised by the authorities and other entities, as well as through support for donation \ndrives. The Government did not take any action against them, whether or not the views \nconcorded with the Government\u2019s position on the conflict. On the other hand, unauthorised \npublic processions could result in public order, and safety and security concerns, and will \nnot be allowed regardless of the cause, or which side the support is for. \n \n8. \nWe would like to urge members of the public not to engage in activities that will damage \nthe peace, public order and social harmony which Singaporeans have worked hard to \nachieve, and enjoy today. We should not deliberately break the law, even if to make a point. \nIf we do so, eventually, we will become a lawless, unstable, and disorderly society.  \n \n9. \nThe Government takes a serious view of the deliberate communication of falsehoods. \nThe Minister for Home Affairs has instructed the POFMA Office to issue a Correction \nDirection1 to the SDP; and for a Targeted Correction Direction2 to be issued to TikTok Pte \nLtd.

The courts did not ascertain whether Tangaraju \nhad any objection to Steven Chong JCA hearing matters relating to Tangaraju\u2019s \ncase. \n \n\uf0b7 Tangaraju was convicted, and sentenced to hang, and later found to be not \nguilty. \n \n\uf0b7 Several personal costs orders were made against M Ravi without justifiable \nbasis, to penalise him for his work in death penalty cases. \n  \nFacts \n \n3. \nTangaraju, a 46-year old Singaporean, was convicted of abetting the trafficking \nof 1017.9 grammes of cannabis. The Misuse of Drugs Act provides for the death \npenalty if the amount of cannabis is more than 500 grammes. 1017.9 grammes is more \nthan twice the capital threshold, and sufficient to feed the addiction of about 150 \nabusers for a week.  \n \n4. \nTangaraju\u2019s allegation that he requested for but was denied an interpreter \nduring the recording of his statement is false, and was rejected by the High Court. The \nHigh Court found this bare allegation, raised for the first time during Tangaraju\u2019s cross-\nexamination, to be disingenuous given Tangaraju\u2019s admission that he had made no \nsuch request for any of the other statements subsequently recorded from him.  \n \n5. \nTangaraju was accorded full due process under the law. He was represented \nby legal counsel and had access to an interpreter throughout his trial.  \n \n6. \nTangaraju\u2019s then counsel was informed, before the appeal was heard, that \nSteven Chong JCA was the Attorney-General when decisions were taken in respect \nof his case. Steven Chong JCA was not, however, involved in the decision-making \nprocess, and Tangaraju\u2019s then counsel was informed of this as well. Tangaraju\u2019s then \ncounsel had replied to confirm that Tangaraju had no objections to Steven Chong JCA \nbeing a member of the coram for the Court of Appeal, to hear his appeal. \n \n7. \nTangaraju\u2019s conviction by the High Court was upheld by the Court of Appeal, \nwhich is the apex court in Singapore.  His conviction has not been overturned.  \n \n8. \nCosts orders were made against M Ravi for justifiable reasons and in \naccordance with the law, as can be found in the court judgments, which are publicly \navailable. Some of these costs orders were made in respect of M Ravi filing \nunmeritorious applications to the courts, which were found to be abuses of the court \nprocess. \n \n9. \nDespite the Government\u2019s clarifications and the courts\u2019 clear findings on \nTangaraju\u2019s case, Han, TJC, M Ravi, Loh and TOCA have persisted in making false \nstatements of fact. These false statements may affect public trust and confidence in \nthe Government and the Judiciary.  \n \n10. \nThe Government takes a serious view of the deliberate communication of \nfalsehoods. The Minister for Communications and Information and Second Minister \nfor Home Affairs has instructed the POFMA Office to issue Correction Directions to \nHan, TJC, M Ravi, Loh and TOCA in respect of Han\u2019s article, Han\u2019s FB posts and \nHan\u2019s tweet, TJC\u2019s FB post, M Ravi\u2019s FB posts, Loh\u2019s FB post, TOCA\u2019s FB and \nLinkedIn posts and tweet, and the TOCA article.  \n \n11. \nFor the facts of the case, please refer to the Factually article \u201cCorrections \nregarding false statements of fact concerning the capital sentence that was meted out \nto Tangaraju s/o Suppiah <https://www.gov.sg/article/factually190523>\u201d. \n \n \nMINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS \n19 MAY 2023 \n",
