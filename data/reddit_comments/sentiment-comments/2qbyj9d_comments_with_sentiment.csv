    If MOH is so certain that Ivermectin does not treat COVID-19, then why did they not use POFMA immediately when the falsehood was spreading?

    When the ‚ÄúAhma takes Ivermectin and ends up in ICU‚Äù news came out in 5 Oct, they should have already started probing the origin of such dangerous falsehood, and they should have already hauled these people to court.

    The government can wield POFMA around so quickly at opposition critics, and yet now they need to take weeks to even consider using the law on something that they already know for a 100% that is false? Is it because they are afraid of offending the hardcore religious demographics which are likely to be conservatives? Give me a break la.

    IIRC OYK wielded the mighty POFMA on his first day as Minister of Health (as a show of power I assume).

    I‚Äôm seriously wondering what took him so long to deliberate on the action to POFMA this kind of fake news - stuff that POFMA is meant for

    One of the persons spreading falsehoods seems to be this OYK.

    One time he said got 1000 ICU beds for covid patients, now he saying 2/3rds of ICU beds occupied (71 beds occupied now only) and hospitals under pressure. What a buffoon!

    Why may be used? Unless there‚Äôs actually some shred of truth in what these anti vaxxers are saying (which there basically isn‚Äôt), why not just POFMA? Really defeats the purpose of having it in the first place if it‚Äôs just used as a political weapon.

    Honestly, while POFMA has been used occasionally to deal with fake news during the pandemic, it's questionable how the more publicized use are on the ""troublemakers"" while something like this that does harm is only a ""maybe we'll POFMA them"".

    If there was ever a use for POFMA, it should be for shit like this. And it should have been exercised ages ago, when all this anti-mask and anti-vax nonsense started gaining traction.

    And they're only NOW thinking about using it?

    Really speaks volumes about what the original intent of POFMA was, eh? Not like we didn't know it then...
