    The fact remains that one certain elite family stays in a govt house on a prime land parcel of some 250,000 sq ft in a land scarce country. It is probably a mere coincidence that the land is managed by a govt stats board that reports to this same elite.

    Mr Jeyaretnam claimed that the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) had charged ministers K Shanmugam and Vivian Balakrishnan rent at below market value for 26 and 31 Ridout Road respectively, and had given them preferential tenancy terms.

    This is just really pathetic quarreling over definitions. KJ is saying ""given the size of the land, the rental is absurdly low and the only people that know that are government officials and anybody bo eng enough to call the SLA hotline"" and the government is saying ""yeah but SLA set it that low so that's the market price.""

    For context, the adjacent plot of land received 3 bids just 6 months ago. Winning bid was $1.4k or so, and the following two bids were $900+, by guocoland and city developments.

    Does the government actually provide evidence or is it just their words against his?

    The article alr said CPIB investigated so that‚Äôs the evidence. Whether you believe CPIB is independent or not is a separate issue.

    GCB rental is around ~ $150k a month. By paying $20k a month for a bigger and more prime plot of land, it‚Äôs a profit of $130k a month and $1.56M a year while doing absolutely nothing. It‚Äôs a smart move in my opinion
