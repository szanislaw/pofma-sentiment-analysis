    Is that CEO really worth so much or its just elites watching out for each other as usual? Hope he gets replaced by AI one day.

    I think Glassdoor estimates the number based on broadly comparable companies (obviously Temasek is around the size of some of the largest MNCs).

    Just looking at the supposed breakdown by the website depicts majority of the compensation being stock issuance and 23 mil in base pay being a minority.

    That's true for most big MNCs but not for Temasek which acts like a sovereign wealth fund. Since Temasek is 100% owned by MOF, it can only issue base pay, bonuses and other cash for the CEO's package.

    Anyway at the end of the day, whether the salary is 30 mil or 50 mil or 90 mil...I don't think it makes a lot of difference. What matters is that it's more well-remunerated than the salary of any other business leader in the SG private sector. And definitely many times of a minister or Perm Sec's salary.
