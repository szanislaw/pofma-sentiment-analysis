    As LMW himself alluded in his clarification/apology, he was too naive and took the couple's word at face value, without realizing that the couple was probably making use of him.  My guess is that the couple  figured getting an opposition politician to KPKB on their behalf would force gahmen to concede and provide them something ""extra"", especially after their MP stepped down in murky circumstances. To be POFMAed so quickly, this couple would already be on the grassroots' radar as potential troublemakers - trust me, there are folks who consistently pester CC staff.  Speaking from personal experience, there are a lot of entitled people in West Coast who feel emboldened after the last GE which allowed LMW to become NCMP.

    They POFMA him so quickly, that I read about the pofma first, lol

    I think one critical problem about our democracy is the information imbalance between the PAP and the opposition.
  "
"
    When you don't share data with the opposition, either publicly or privately, the opposition can only make use of the information of third party sources and whatever news comes out by the state media to form an opinion and then act accordingly.
  "
"
    At least in the UK, the opposition party not only has a shadow cabinet with access to government data, but the shadow ministers in fact get a chance to meet officials from other countries alongside the actual ministers. This at least allows the opposition a chance to have a fair fight in parliament and in elections.

    In the case of LMW, he can only rely on the information provided by the couple. He has no way to check how accurate the information is since he is not in government. Sure, he could contact the public ministries themselves, but would the agencies really give away the information to him? Especially since it's private information and as stated, the government likes to gatekeep data until they have the upper hand.

    LWM is a NCMP only. I've seen WP members being invited to official meetings before.

    MAS claimed the financial times published false information yet no POFMA. NAC claimed Today published misleading information, yet no POFMA.

    Mr Leong had falsely claimed that the couple only receives a Home Caregiving Grant and that they do not currently receive any other form of financial assistance from public sector agencies for their daily expenses, said MSF.
  "
"
    In truth, the couple have also been receiving financial assistance each month in the form of NTUC vouchers from the People’s Association and utilities vouchers from the Community Development Council. These started in February and March 2022 respectively, said MSF.
  "
"
    They also receive S$300 (US$223) each month from a temple, the Ministry added. In total, they currently receive a total of around S$830 per month in cash and vouchers.
  "
"
    ""Since 2021, the couple have received approximately S$39,000 in cash and vouchers from various public sector agencies and community partners. This included S$21,000 in ComCare assistance from May 2021 to April 2023,"" said MSF.
  "
"
    The couple currently have more than $S100,000 in total in both their CPF Retirement Accounts. In April 2023, the woman withdrew S$5,000 from her account.
  "
"
    Lol I didn't think that if you'd have to account for every single voucher you've received.
  "
"
    And for all of us whinging about our CPF being drained, be careful otherwise they will reveal how much you have.
  "
"
    Stay classy, MSF!
  "
"
    Similar to a previous case, they only revealed all the numbers after the persons were identified first
  "
"
    Govt bodies usually don't show hand unless the other party shows hand first. Usually the person who shows hand first is caught bluffing
  "
"
    Says a lot that your reaction is somehow ""stay classy MSF"", rather than ""stay classy LMW"" for posting another story without verification, or ""stay classy couple"" for misrepresenting the assistance they received.
