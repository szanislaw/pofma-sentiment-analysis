    Ainâ€™t his bro also a judge? ðŸ’€
  "

    Probably why Kenneth J is able to speak quite authoritatively on the topic. You will note that the POFMA is only on the ""judges' bonus"" issue, but not the ""who appoints the judges"" issue.
  "
"
    is it the policy of the government to use POFMA as a first response or a last resort? what are the precise criteria for the use of POFMA given ""misinformation"" from far more influential publications have recieved a much more gentle response? I refer to examples such as TODAY's ""misleading"" article about NAC, or the Financial Times article which MAS claimed was false.

    these are the questions MPs should be asking, instead of making wayang beebo speeches

    POFMA is todayâ€™s version of the 1980s civil defamation suits thrown to his father

    If any or all of this is not true then Iâ€™m sure Singaporeans would welcome Shanâ€™s clarification.
  "
"
    I find it concerning that POFMA is used as a proxy for Shanmugam's clarification. He could very easily have issued a clarification either on his personal profile or via MinLaw, as is the norm.
  "
"
    But the fact that he just chose to POFMA - and only part of the facts at that - speaks volumes of his modus operandi.  Very much ""rules for thee but not for me, I can just use the heaviest weapon I have to mow down KJ"".
  "
"
    Yeah. At some point, its quite interesting to see whats NOT being POFMA'd.
  "
"
    I don't know if they understand that by the time something reaches the stage where you can POFMA it, it has spread to enough people and a certain percentage of those people won't care if the original information has been debunked. If anything, it just fuels the anti-PAP sentiments and the idea that they have something to hide.
  "
"
    It's better to issue corrections and try to spread this via their own channels than to try to take down Jeyaretnam because at this point it's quite clear he doesn't care how many POFMAs he gets.

    Lol just disclose all senior public & political office holders' salaries la. As long as you draw part or all of your livelihood from the Consolidated Fund, all your annual taxable income should be made publicly available.
  "

    I agree. I had to look through MOF's budget to even guess how much Lee Hsien Loong is drawing as Senior Minister now.
  "
"
    There's no transparency or ""clean wages"" unless they really show it.
  "

    Pofma is in essence a butthurt minister whinging.

    I find it hard to relate to shan QQing from the comfort of his ridout road b/w.

    From KJ's facebook post, the para that was POFMAed
  "
"
    ""In this case nonly have Vivian and Shan not stepped down but Shan is Law Minister and thus under the Singapore system may have some input, along with the PM, into the appointment and promotion of High Court judges and into the size of their performance bonuses which I understand can be up to 3 months salary. If any or all of this is not true then Iâ€™m sure Singaporeans would welcome Shanâ€™s clarification.  ""
  "
"
    I guess the POFMA clarified that per the relevant acts, the MPs decide the renumeration of the justices, the bonuses determined by the CJ, also the package can't go down after appointment.
  "
"
    the word may have some input doesn't mean determine. The act is clear - the CJ is the one who determines. Does it mean that the influence of the PM and Shan play a part in both the legislature as well as their relationship with the CJ? Well i don't think the POFMA actually addresses that point.
  "
"
    But of course the onus is on KJ to provide substantive proof (e.g. a history of incidences that has led him to that conclusion) The issue is that he probably doesn't. But should he actually be asking for a FOIA act so that at least parliamentarians can request for such information since there is no investigative journalism in Singapore.
  "
"
    A bit weird that judges (and politicians) receive performance bonuses.
  "
"
    5 pofma = 1.2 month bonus /s
  "
"
    how much judge earn ah...so power
  "
"
    Should he be awarded a lifetime achievement upon getting his 10th POFMA?
  "
"
    I just realised that KJ lives in the UK..? But if he's the sec-gen of a political party here, shouldn't be be living here? Cos if he gets elected, would he move here or continue staying in the UK?
  "
"
    a minor issue, cos he wont be elected.
  "
"
    The idea is that he works in the UK because no one will hire him in SG due to politics.
  "
"
    When there is no FOIA, some parties might choose to use this as a reverse tool. If something doesnâ€™t get POFMA-ed, they assume it to be credible.
  "
"
    Why canâ€™t it just be a clarification? What is with the use of PoFMA
