    Did he say that? I don't trust TOC's articles.
  "
"
    Sure. Pofma all they want.
  "

    Whether people believe or not is another thing though.

    Yeah but the PAP is the one deciding whether something is truthful or a falsehood. Ministry of Truth.

    I only believe what I see and we all can see what POFMA is used for.

    Economist published misrepresentations according to SG high comm: no POFMA

    Scandalous article gets post online

    A law that for starters doesn't definite what fake news is, is totally something that wouldn't be abused /s

    Watch this article get POFMAed for highly nuanced reasons.

    lol. lmao even

    Whether you want to believe or don’t believe pofma is the superficial top layer.
  "

    More importantly, many people don’t realise this but pofma is used to give people chance. Without pofma the alternative would be legal action already.
  "

    Such a “serious requirement” yet most countries don’t feel a need for it
  "
"
    It is a good way to determine which articles/postings are factually wrong. Too bad POFMA doesn't go far enough to make perennial falsehood peddlers liable for prosecution and jail for getting multiple orders.
