    Bro really trying to collect POFMA like PokÃ©mon cards.
  "

    Its likely they found his first video from a month back amd someone had to go through everything since the first pofma. Yeah the claims are unverified with regards to tracking your vote. The way i view it is that they could track your vote if they wanted. Do i think they do track our votes? No. What i would say is that he is entertaining. Stumbled upon his video about tan chuan jin, it was quite hilarious. But as for his rants, just sounds like any deranged uncle having a go at the govt.

    Now bro under the radar they'll dig up all the shit he spread.

    This guy has all the hallmarks of a Desker Road snake oil saleman. Street accent, glib tongue, speaks with confidence, uses words that aunties and uncles like and gives an air of authority.
  "

    So was wondering what snake oil he was selling. Apparently he is muslim convert, active in Muslimâ€™s Converts Association and holds some sort of minor leadership position, Says he is a life coach and fitness trainer. Looks like he targeting the vulnerable pool positioning himself as some sort of savant and fighter for peopleâ€™s right.

    Title: TikTok user issued POFMA correction order again for making false claims about CPF
  "
"
    Minster for Manpower Tan See Leng has instructed the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) Office to issue a Correction Direction to TikTok user @dr.ishhaq.jay and a Targeted Correction Direction to TikTok in relation to a TikTok video posted on Aug. 12 by the said user.
  "
"
    Just two days prior, the same TikTok user was issued with a POFMA order for a TikTok video posted on Jul. 17.
  "
"
    Made false claims about CPF
  "
"
    In @dr.ishhaq.jay's TikTok video, he falsely claimed that no one among low and middle income CPF members who utilised their CPF monies to repay their HDB loan has met either the Basic Retirement Sum (BRS) or Full Retirement Sum in their CPF accounts.
  "
"
    This statement is false, as according to the CPF's Board's data, almost seven in 10 active CPF members have set aside their cohort's BRS at age 55 in 2022.
  "
"
    This proportion includes members earning below the median income for those aged 55 years old in 2022 who have used their CPF savings to repay housing loans.
  "
"
    He will be required to create a new TikTok post containing a correction notice which states that the TikTok Post contains a false statement of fact, and provide a link to the Governmentâ€™s clarification.
  "
"
    TikTok Pte. Ltd. will also be required to communicate a correction notice to all end-users in Singapore who had accessed the TikTok Post.
  "
"
    Was issued with POFMA order two days before
  "
"
    The TikTok user was issued with a correction order on Aug. 18.
  "
"
    He falsely claimed that the government can trace who a voter has voted for in order to penalise the voter based on his or her vote.
  "
"
    This is false, as according to government fact-checking site Factually, only personnel at the polling stations or at the counting of votes can see who the voter votes for. These personnel have to make an oath of secrecy.
  "
"
    The government, including the Elections Department, has complied strictly with the statutory procedures and obligations relating to voting secrecy, as a matter of policy and practice.

    He declares he's a 'life coach' but can anyone find any publicity or testimonials online about his experience? I couldn't find anything, so either all his coaching is done very quietly without publicity of any sort, or he's trumpeting non-existent skills set.
