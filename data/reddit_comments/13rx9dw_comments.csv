    In an email response to Ang, the POFMA office claimed that the relevant ministry or ministries are “in the best position” to assess whether a statement is false and determine if it is in the public interest to take action.

    they found a new way to say “ownself check ownself” lol
  "
"
    POFMA is one of those law that the government uses on its people but not the other way around
  "
"
    The response from the POFMA office is, in essence, ""I'm gonna taichi you to other ministries, and cc the Prime Minister's Office"".

    Biggest omission: in 1980 majority of families only needed single Income to hit the median level. Mother gets to stay home to raise the kids.
  "
"
    Today it's largely dual income in order to barely achieve median household income.
  "
"
    Tldr: Singaporeans have to work twice as hard today to achieve the same house hold income in the 1980s.
  "
"
    One other omission: household incomes are higher now as more children are staying with parents whilst waiting for balloting, eligibility, or construction time.
  "
"
    lmao I guess false information is fine if it benefits the right people
  "
"
    and don't forget well funded state media blindly repeating ministerial speeches while it falls to some random blogger to do the real journalistic work (AGAIN)
  "
"
    The chosen stats presented was also cherry picked. For example median household income in 1980 was from single income which was very common. The median household income now is from dual income.
  "
"
    With more young adults staying with their parents, now you can have 3-4 people with income! Household income banzai!

    Well we know what pofma is for. Anyone couldve told you this the day it was passed. Why the hell would they pofma themselves.

    Another reason to not vote for the incumbent in 2025. Voting for the first time and will not make any mistake in my decision.

    Wow 01 babies can vote damn I feel old
  "
"
    Wow if this is for real…its not fair at all…they need to at least get the person to acknowledge it and ensure that will work on accuracy
  "

    The quoted statistics can come from different sources and estimates, or have different underlying definitions e.g. citizen households vs resident households. Just because two different ministers quoted different numbers doesn't mean that one is lying.
  "
"
    The income stats were really nitpicking. What LW wanted to point out was that median household income went up 10x.
  "
"
    LW's numbers: $900 in 1980, $9000 in 2022. Ratio of 10.
  "
"
    Ang's numbers: $990 in 1980, $10,099 in 2022. Ratio of 10.2.
  "
"
    Are these small discrepancies between sources really so troubling?
  "
"
    The cost of the 4-room flat is more problematic. Put aside BTO not being a scheme yet in 1980; the audience can reasonably deduce that LW meant a newly built flat in 1980, not a built-to-order flat. Based on the ad that Ang dug up, it was actually a 5-room new town flat in 1980 that cost $40k, not a 4-room flat like LW claimed. This could be a meaningful discrepancy, since it would imply that affordability has gone down; the median household could afford a 5-room flat in 1980 but now can only afford a 4-room flat.
  "
"
    This blogger would have a lot more credibility if this was the only mistake he picked on, rather than adding in the ~10% differences in income stats and the technicality of BTO vs new flat.

    POFMA defines a 'false statement of fact' as a false or misleading statement which a reasonable person would consider to be a representation of fact.

    Minister ought to read his fucking rulebook that him and his chumps passed into law from time to time.

    Minister ought to read his fucking rulebook

"
    For what?
  "
"
    As if he will get POFMA'd.
  "
"
    This was LW’s May Day Speech, not him talking at some CC event.
  "
"
    Strange that LW (a PM-in-waiting) can just read out the entire speech without double-checking the numbers beforehand, or notice the jarring fact that the BTO scheme did not exist in 1980?
  "
"
    How is this guy PM calibre if he can’t tell that the figures seemed off? He has lived through that era, and it’s a well known fact that BTO is only a recent thing. How does he not know?
  "
"
    Ministers today are not of the same calibre as ministers of yesteryear.
  "
"
    Rules for thee but not for me.
  "
"
    Please at least read the items that the blogger, Phillip Ang is flagging out to POFMA office and not just the catchy title.

Quotation from LW Speech
"
"
    DPM Wong: ""In 1980, the price of a 4R BTO flat (1) in a new town at that time indeed was around $40,000 (2). But back then, the median household income was around $900 (3)… But the median household income has risen ten times too, from $900 to $9,000 today. (4)""

Falsehood No. 1 claimed

    In 1980, the BTO scheme did not even exist; it was launched 21 years later in 2001, fully implemented in 2002. HDB introduces the Build-to-order system – Singapore History (nlb.gov.sg)

    Fair enough on a technicality level
  "

Falsehood No. 2 claimed
"
"
    The price of a 4R flat (RFS, non BTO) in a new town in 1980 was not $40,000. According to an online media article, a 4R flat was priced at $27,100. Price of 4-room HDB flats in new town sold at $27,000 and not $40,000 in 1980 – The Online Citizen Asia

    The TOC article referenced an archived New Nation article (1979). Newspaper Article – Your guide to buying a flat – or, New Nation, 7 June 1979, Page 10/11 (nlb.gov.sg)
  "
"
    As can be seen in the New Nation image below, the price of a 4R flat in a new town was indeed $27,100.
  "
"
    Didnt look too much into the details of this but at least there is a source backing the discrepancy.

Falsehood No. 3 claimed
"
"
    In a 2015 speech, then-DPM Tharman said: ""But, remember, the median household income was just $990 in 1980 (compared to $7,320 last year)."" sequential (mof.gov.sg) (see page 11)
  "
"
    DPM Wong should have known that $990 is not ""around $900"".
  "
"
    This is just nit picking isnt it?
  "
"
Falsehood No. 4 claimed
"
"
    According to a recent CNA article, the median household income in 2022 was $10,099, not ""$9000 today"". Median household income in Singapore rose slightly in 2022 to S$10,099 – CNA (channelnewsasia.com)

    Surprise surprise, an error that, if corrected at face value, actually further supports the establishment's narrative (regardless of how the numbers can be gamed)
  "
"
    Well the reply from POFMA office is nothing much to be expected of, the standard we will look into it because the one responding to the email definitely isnt the one making the decision on whether to POFMA, neither would they announce a decision to POFMA through email to a random individual.
  "
"
    And yes its stupid that anything that is POFMA-ed is instantly made to seem like an intentional lie rather than an error, mis-interpretation or different perspective.
