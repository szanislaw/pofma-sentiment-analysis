"‚ÄúFurthermore, the Government is not in a position to freely or unilaterally decide to spend any part of the past reserves. Any drawing of the past reserves is subject to the President‚Äôs concurrence.‚Äù

remind me when was the last time the President disagreed with the govt",NEU
"Yikes, Yeoh can't catch a break huh.

MOF needs to at least throw us a bone imho. Any enquiry made in Parliament about our reserves or fiscal status by MPs on both sides (yes PAP MPs have asked too) have been rebutted, usually with the 'not meaningful to disclose' line.

Even when WP asked if the reserves are higher or lower after COVID spending, the ministry has demurred. People are naturally going to doubt and ask whether we are oversaving when there isn't even a clue.

At least give us a range and explain the general intent for the reserves. Trust is built both ways - I wanna trust the government but they need to give us more and not treat us as dummies who can't math.",NEG
Don't need to show proof just POFMA. Great for political discourse in Singapore.,POS
"Hm looks like the Govt caught Yeoh for being *technically* wrong - same kind of mistake he made previously when he claimed HDB made a profit (factually wrong - the larger Government may profit, but HDB the stat board itself does not since it pays SLA for the land it uses).

When he said the Govt has 30bn in surplus, he's including the Reserves which technically the current Government *cannot* (legally) spend unless the President agrees. So, technically the Government is correct to POFMA this factual inaccuracy. Obviously, we all know what Yeoh *means* to say but didn't - ie. that with the current supermajority and a friendly President, the PAP government obviously would have no real impediment to spending as much of the Reserves as they want to. Seems to me that he might have been able to avoid this POFMA in one of two ways:

1. Either be more precise in his language (which would've made his FB post more wordy); or
2. Phrase his post as an opinion not a fact (since opinions cannot be POFMAed) - e.g. ""In my opinion, the Government should be spending its Reserves rather than hoarding it for some god-knows-what event, by which time we all might be dead already!""

&amp;#x200B;

The Govt for its part could be more gracious (yeah I know, I know - wait long long!) by acknowledging that Yeoh's 30bn figure is based on a *fundamentally different method* of calculating (e.g includes land sales) and explain why the Govt does not use Yeoh's method (because Govt regards land sales as Past reserves etcetc).

That way, instead of shutting down discourse, observers like us can see where both sides are coming from and maybe make up our own minds. I mean, some people actually *do* support the idea of protecting our Reserves so they might even partially or wholly agree with the Govt in this particular instance.",NEG
"come on MOF you really expect us to believe that a former chief economist at GIC who worked there for 26 years, and who was also a senior economist for MAS doesn't know what he is talking about? what next, are we gonna POFMA LKY?

&gt;Mr Lee published a book in 2000 titled 'From Third World To First'. **This is false.** Singapore is a self declared developing country in the WTO. A POFMA notice has been sent to 38 Oxley road, and all copies of this book are to carry a label ""Warning: False Information""",NEU

"Genuinely don‚Äôt believe we only have fiscal surplus of 2 billion‚Ä¶ when Temasek plays with hundreds of billions. seems like tricky math.

If it‚Äôs really 2 billion then Temasek pissed off 1/6 on FTX‚Ä¶which absolutely makes it sound worst.",NEG
Anti fake news law use like this .....,NEU
"Maybe the govt is right because at the rate that Temasek is fucking its AUM up, YLK's number not so high any more... /s",NEG
"If I remember this correctly, the surpluses disclosed by the govt in parliament (or to the sg public) does not include revenue from land sales. So both sides could be right in this case. Strangely though, the figures that the govt report to IMF (or is it the UN?) Includes land sales, and that stat is open source info. So if Yeoh was quoting that figure, not sure what's there to POFMA on.

Incidentally, this would square with Indranee's assertion that land sales doesn't increase Sg's asset value as the value was already calculated in the reserves, just that it was converted from land value to cash value.",NEU
Collecting POFMA like collecting Pokemon,NEU
"&gt;&gt; Refuting his claim, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) said that the S$30 billion figure cited by Mr Yeoh was untrue.

&gt;&gt; Over the last two decades, excluding the 2020 financial year which had a significant fiscal deficit due to Covid-19 spending, the Government recorded on average a fiscal balance of S$2.2 billion per year, it said in a statement.

So it should be 2.2 x 20 = S$44 billion?",NEU
