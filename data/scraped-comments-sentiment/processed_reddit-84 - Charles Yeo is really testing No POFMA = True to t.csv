"This pofma nonsense will bite the ruling party hard in the ass, one day.

Seems like it's better to say/accuse any and everyone on any and every political subject, wait a while, if no pofma, then must be true. More work for PAP. ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£. If theres a degree of truth to an allegation and the PAP wants it suppressed, they have to provide evidence on their end to refute it. Headache ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£",NEG

"Actually, POFMA is a very convenient tool to manage what is spoken in public, especially dissent, or what the government sees as falsehood and malice. The government doesn't have to sue for defamation, which could compel them to release information to the courts. Instead, they can prosecute the person for non-compliance of POFMA, which is straight forward and obvious.",POS
