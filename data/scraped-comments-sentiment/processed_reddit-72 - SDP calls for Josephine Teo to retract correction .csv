"How to abuse pofma: 

1. Have someone spread rumor/ post fake news about classified information and drag ministers name.

2. Pofma forced to say the truth and reveal classified information.

"for all its criticisms, pofma is pretty interesting because it sets the scene for transparent debate. ministry needs to come back with a rigorous reply and bring relevant stats this time

sad thing tho is that if discussion between ministry and SDP already lacking in rigour, then how can citizens as a whole be expected to have rigorous discussions/views on societal issues?",POS
"&gt;For example, MOM had said the opposition party claimed that ""(local) PMET retrenchment has been increasing"", referring to professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMETs).  
&gt;  
&gt;However, SDP claimed that its Facebook post “clearly said ‘unemployment’ but MOM changed it to ‘retrenchment’ – two different subjects – and then accused us of making a ‘false statement of fact’”.

Can SDP use POFMA against MOM or not ah",NEU
"Lol when they introduced this POFMA thing, they probably thought “Yay! Now everyone will just shut up.”

Now everyone will just test water and push out articles. Which in turns leads to the Govt actually needing to answer with facts.",NEU

"If I were to adjudicate and give sdp a 7/10 over this episode, I'd take half a point off for the silly student analogy barb.

When the pap does this to the opposition for doing something dumb, I find it arrogant.

Keep it classy. Or come up with a better barb at least.",NEG
"Noticed the MOM response did not address the points raised by SDP's rebuttal. The MOM merely re-stated that the original articles were ""fake news"". I'd like to see the MOM actually correcting SDP's articles and assertions point-by-point, just for intellectual rigour, if nothing else.",NEG
Interesting case of what happens with the accused party makes a defence from POFMA. How the government handles this will determine the tenor of such discussions and the overall health of public debate in Singapore in the years to come.,NEU
"Pofma is a joke. Same goes for our G. 
The comfort that Singaporeans would only vote for one party has deluded them. Thus, making them so comfortable with making their so called “unpopular but necessary decisions”.",NEG
"&gt; # SDP calls for Josephine Teo to retract correction directions, apologise

&gt; SINGAPORE — The Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) says that Manpower Minister Josephine Teo owes the opposition party an “immediate, unambiguous and public apology” over correction directions imposed on the SDP last month.

&gt; In a media statement on Thursday (2 January), the SDP claimed the directions – made against two Facebook posts and an online article by the party – had abused the Protection Against Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA).

&gt; “The problem lies with the fact that MOM had accused the SDP of making statements that we did not make or cited different sets of data which it then used to accuse the SDP's post as false,” said the party, referring to the Ministry of Manpower (MOM).

&gt; The statement said the party “categorically rejects” the correction notices, and stressed that the statements made in the three posts that Teo cited are “true and correct”.On 14 December, the POFMA Office issued a Correction Direction to the SDP over two Facebook posts and an online article titled, “SDP Population Policy: Hire S’poreans First, Retrench S’poreans last”.

&gt; The POFMA Office said the posts contained falsehoods regarding the nation’s population policy. SDP was required to add a correction note to the three posts, and it has since complied.

&gt; In its statement, SDP accused MOM of distorting the facts.

&gt; For example, MOM had said the opposition party claimed that ""(local) PMET retrenchment has been increasing"", referring to professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMETs).

&gt; However, SDP claimed that its Facebook post “clearly said ‘unemployment’ but MOM changed it to ‘retrenchment’ – two different subjects – and then accused us of making a ‘false statement of fact’”.

&gt; “This is clearly an abuse of the law,” the party added.

&gt; SDP also alluded to a line in its post about the “rising proportion of Singapore PMETs getting retrenched”. The party claimed that this is a “factual statement” that referred to local PMETs getting retrenched as a proportion of all local retrenched workers.

&gt; However, Teo cited a different statistic in the Correction Direction, that of “local PMETs retrenched as a proportion of all local PMET employees”.

&gt; SDP claimed that Teo used this data, which did not show a rising trend, to label the SDP’s statement as false. The party added that MOM’s post and its own are based on “two separate and distinct sets of information” – both of which are true depending on which denominator is used.

&gt; “How can the MOM choose a different statistic and then use it to say that the SDP's post contains ‘false statements of fact’? Again, this is an abuse of POFMA,” said SDP.

&gt; Rebutting MOM’s claim that there is “no rising trend of retrenchment, whether amongst PMETs or otherwise”, SDP cited the ministry’s own data from 2010 which it said “shows clearly that there is in fact a rising trend of PMET retrenchments in Singapore”.

&gt; “POFMA's stated intention is to prevent deliberate online falsehoods, not disagreements over the use of statistics,” said the SDP, who accused MOM of a “lack of intellectual rigour”.

&gt; “A student presenting such work would get an F grade”, it added.

&gt; The ministry has used the anti-fake news law for “political-partisan purposes” and to stymie legitimate criticism of the PAP's foreign PMET policy that has been and continues to be unfair to Singaporeans, said SDP.

&gt; “That the general election is not far away makes our case even more salient... If POFMA is to have legitimate authority going forward, then Ms Teo must apologise to the SDP,” it added.

I am confused and really have no idea who is right and who is wrong. What I am certain of is that this Government will never admit their error. And if they did may lightening me strike where I stand. Same Government that coined the term ponding for floods.,NEG
"It's slightly scary yet at the same time amusing to see our government carry themselves like a bunch of kids squabbling around who's right or wrong rather than tackling the issues that were raised. They are being paid so much due to their qualifications and to prevent corruption in Singapore. But yet somehow it feels slightly corrupted already. 

People can openly talk about the government but when they are being taken seriously, the government has the power to shut those people down. I love Singapore but when it comes to such stuff, it kinda feels like a low key dictatorship with the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer.",NEG
"omg did u say the MOM reply? instead of responding to sdp's claims, they say ""there's a process to follow""?? what the hell??",NEG
"&gt; SDP also alluded to a line in its post about the “rising proportion of Singapore PMETs getting retrenched”. The party claimed that this is a “factual statement” that referred to local PMETs getting retrenched as a proportion of all local retrenched workers.

I'm not sure with all these drama if people noticed how misleading the original statement was. I mean which reader will read “rising proportion of Singapore PMETs getting retrenched” and assume they actually mean as a proportion of all local retrenched worker as opposed to a more logical proportion of all local PMET workers. 

But lets say we give them the benefit of a doubt and assume that that was what they had in mind when they made that statement. Even then, how is that an social issue? That is like complaining the average amount of individual income tax has been increasing without considering that it is likely due to average income increasing (which is good). In the same way, the increasing proportion of local PMET getting retrenched out of all local retrenched worker can be because there is an increase in the proportion of local PMET workers (which is good).

I'm not saying their number are fake. Just misleading or dumb if they really think that that statistic indicate a social issue. But this also brings up a point, even if a statement is vague or misleading, should the government invoke the fake news law against it?",NEU
