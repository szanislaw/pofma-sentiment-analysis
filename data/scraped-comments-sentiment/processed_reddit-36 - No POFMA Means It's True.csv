Are you telling me iswaran helped those ceca FTs get PR? This alone is enough for me to vote him out.,NEG
"Wait so the allegations were that OBS booked a VVIP suite for Iswaran, who then used it to show off to his CECA business partners?

Doesn't sound that serious to me, or am I missing something?",NEU
Wtf?,NEG
This is damn nonsense la. All the ministers that went to F1 were housed in the same suite.,NEG
Better check all ministers with third party. No more ownself check ownself...,NEU
"The key is not so much the privileges he gained, but what he provided in return. In return for some of this lavishness, the man seems to have granted F1 to be in Singapore for the longest contract extension ever.",POS
"This is the actual picture shared in TOC's article regarding billionaire and middleman for F1 in SG, Ong Beng Seng, being involved in the ongoing CPIB corruption probe against Transport Minister S Iswaran.

As described in my other post, Ong has history in SG with corruption scandals involving the ruling Lee Dynasty (Nassim Jade). The F1 contract renewal in 2022 for 7 years after 2 years being cancelled due to Covid-19 came as a surprise to everybody, especially when even SG state media such as CNA had put out opinion pieces questioning whether SG truly needed F1 anymore considering its financial cost.

**Iswaran was Transport Minister and signed off on F1's latest 7-year contract with SG.**

Didnâ€™t know that a random WhatsApp message being forwarded many times = truth ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,NEG
"is Minister knew the cost was paid by OBS and yet invited his personal guest then i think its corruption. Using your advantage as Minister for your own gains.

But if he didnt know, he cant declare and wont be considered corruption. Now depends what OBS says. And needs proof he invited people from another country or personal friends to the event which he shouldnt and goes as Corruption.

Wonder if they wanna cover this for the rideout situation.",NEG
