it is also interesting to read the pofma directive in full. it is quite clear that the pofma directive mischaracterised the original Jom article and claims that it made certain statements when it did not.,NEU
"This was Instagram’s wording, according to TOC: “[We] received a legal request to restrict this content. We reviewed it against our policies, conducted a legal and human rights assessment, and restricted access to the content in the location where it goes against local law.”

If we accept the government’s denial at face value, then it’s likely Livspace or Ravindran Shanmugam filed a request with a Singapore court, claiming the post contained false information and was likely to cause harm. The court approved it, granted the order, then the filer submitted the order to Meta.

It could have been a stop publication order or disabling order, under the POHA law: https://www.judiciary.gov.sg/civil/understand-outcomes-protection-from-harassment

Or it could have been a different type of order granted under a different law. Either way, we can be pretty sure they got an order from a Singapore court. Jom did jump to conclusions. It’s a little sloppy of them. 

edit: You mentioned that it is odd for Instagram to receive such an order then block it only in Singapore. If anything, this is the norm. Content is usually blocked only in the country where the court issued the order. This is a good thing. In many countries it is quite easy to get a court order. If a local order could trigger a global block, it would be ripe for abuse.",NEU
"A request to block can be from any party, individual or entity, public or private and with the aid of a law firm behind the request it would be effective. Companies may act so they are not liable.

There are law firms here that specialises in this and local influencers and social media identities who have a large following use these firms though any legal firm can do this. It also includes request to take down or remove content including those who do not want to got to the Police for such things as revenge porn etc.

The last thing a commercial entity is interested in is free speech. It does not pay the bills.

JOM made a silly error as the son was not in the trade, nor working in the country at the material time which is easily verified in the Linkedin acct. Others had already flagged this false allegation. Nobody with standing or needing to burnish their credentials would support a false allegation.

On the other matter that the POFA raised against JOM is contentious. JOM could have tightened its language and still have the same effect as no sane person would have bought SM Teo’s argument or explanation.",NEU
the legal request could be from livspace?,NEU
"This is why we need our public spaces - including virtual public spaces - owned by the public and not by private corporations. 

It would be unthinkable for our parks, botanic gardens and other public gathering spaces to be owned by private entities. Virtual gathering spaces should be no different from physical ones - not subject to a corporate tyranny (which in turn exposes it to governmental tyranny).",NEU
Tell the POFMA office to issue u a black and white and you can posted here and ppl can happily post related documents,NEU
"Is POFMA becoming a tool to shut down any allegation that they cannot defend?

Asking for a friend.",NEG
