The pool of financially ready buyers in the minorities pool is smaller as compared to the majority. Is that what he is hinting in another way?,NEU
"this guy very funny one. 

always kpkb about gahmen say housing very expensive, but then ownself stay million dollar estate in queenstown and want to sell and profit from it. 

very shiok, want to benefit from gahmen then want to scold them also",NEU
"I mean, if you want to POFMA property agents, what about the claims that property prices will rise to perpetuity? And that you will have “negative equity” because of CPF accrued interest?",NEG
This agent/salesperson seems to say whatever that suits his agenda or perhaps fill his pocket..,NEU
"I don’t know about 500k but 4 years ago it was around 100k difference for 4rm units in queenstown.

Edit: HDB and the gov have all the data to see if there’s a significant difference in price. Should be a simple SQL query.",NEU
"Typical profiteering scum behavior. Once he benefits from the policy, he tries to bring attention to the said policy to get it abolished so he don’t have to suffer from the drawbacks of it and maximize his profits.

Plays race as well to achieve his objective. I hope he gets punished for stoking racial tensions for his personal benefit.",NEG
So why doesn’t he bring up the other side of the stone that obtaining the flat through EIP is significantly easier being a minority hence it should also be abolished to be fair ? Or is it in benefit to him then so he won’t bring it up?,NEU
"This is a strange use of POFMA.

If I benefit from BTO but lose out from resale, and I decided to talk about losing out from resale, I get a POFMA stating that I should focus on benefit from BTO?

POFMA is to correct falsehood, not to correct focus.",NEG
I watched that video. wtf! that got him pofma,NEG
He is crying foul because he benefited from the scheme? What a good demonstration of biting the hand that feeds you,NEG
The question is did he mention he got his flat through SBF? If he didn’t it tells a lot about it his character.,NEU
"Hmm
But isn’t what he saying true?
The smaller the community size, the smaller the number of people who first will be interested and second can afford to buy million dollar resale property?


Also since now we have double barrel race thing, why do we still have EIP??

But maybe speak to all minority owners who sold their flats in recent months and ask their views",NEU
You can see what our million dollar ministers are anxious about just by looking at how Pofma is deployed,NEU
"I think the main point he is trying to make is the relevance of EIP in today’s society.
Is EIP still effective as it was in the past where there were racial conflicts arising from racial enclaves. I don’t know the answer really. I think EIP is like a preventive measure to ensure racial harmony in Singapore.",NEU

*He called the EIP unfair, and posited that an ethnic-minority flat owner would likely have to “give close to a half a million (dollar) discount to sell their house”, given the Chinese EIP limit.*

Is he saying that minorities cannot afford his flat thus calling EIP unfair? Hasn't he benefitted from owning an asset worth a million dollars? Nowadays minorities are also quite rich, it wouldn't be an issue selling his flat since it is at a freaking prime location isn't it?",NEG
"Seems like he is not very knowledgeable in this field sia, property agent somemore.",NEG
Lol self pwn,NEU
"Does Riddout Road have EIP also, to fill in the estate quota ?",NEU
