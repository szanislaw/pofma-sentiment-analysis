"“The SDP will be required to carry correction notices with its Facebook and Instagram posts and create a new TikTok post with the correction notice.”

Whatever your position, being told by the government to make a TikTok video has got to be one of the most humorous things i’ve read in awhile",NEU
"Regardless of what you think about the march itself, the POFMA and the SDP post straight up aren't talking about the same thing.


SDP's primary argument is that the Constitutional right to free speech and assembly are being infringed upon by strict public order laws, while the POFMA says the SDP claims the girls are being prosecuted because they *disagree with the government*.


It's also telling that the POFMA, which should be about prosecuting falsehoods, spends a good third of its length arguing, in very nakedly political terms, about how much people like not dealing with protests and those degenerate ang mohs protesting overseas. POFMA is a tool for the PAP to repress uncomfortable narratives, that's it.",NEG
