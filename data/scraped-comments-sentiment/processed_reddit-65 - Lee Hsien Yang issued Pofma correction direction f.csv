"Oh my.. the POFMA for claiming ""SPH Media Trust inflated their circulation numbers"" is ridiculous.

The correction essentially says ""no no. SPH inflated their numbers. Not SPH media trust."" Lol",NEG
"nowhere does he say that the trees were felled or the renovations were sponsored *because they were ministers*. he said:

&gt;Two ministers have leased state-owned mansions from the agency that one of them controls, felling trees and getting state-sponsored renovations.

once again the POFMA office comes up with its own version of what was said, omits the original statement from its press release, and declares their version a ""false statement""",NEU
"Thank you POFMA, for bringing attention to an article that is talking shit about the government that I initially didn't know about.",NEG
The furious rate of POFMAs over minor technical points strongly suggests that the PAP is at the moment in a panic over losing control over public opinion.,NEG
"Very telling that the ""corrections"" are on things that nobody cares about.

For example, the first point is that the trees were felled because the ministers rented the properties. We would infer that this means they wanted to do renovations and clear the land for their own use, and that the main problem that people have is that the trees were felled for superfluous reasons and that there is significant environmental damage done. However, the ""correction"" corrects things like whether the ministers used their minister powers to clear the land, or the safety in felling the trees and that ENV approved it. The important questions have been completely skipped.",NEG
"At this rate ministers gonna spend all their time POFMA-ing instead of, yknow, serving the public. 

Also wonder what LHY has to lose by ignoring this entirely.",NEG
"Jamus: This warms the cockles of my heart.

"""Wei Ling and I stated in June 2017 that 'We do not trust Lee Hsien Loong as a brother or as a leader.'  These latest facts speak volumes. Hsien Loong‚Äôs regime does not deserve Singaporeans‚Äô trust.""

I've always taken what he said with a pinch of salt, but with recent fiascos I'm starting to think he might be on to something.",NEG
"So weird how POFMA is exclusively used to correct stories about the Govt. The internet is full of fake news that they totally ignore. It‚Äôs clearly a political tool, not a means to ensure accurate information.",NEG

"If you post 20 slightly wrong post everyday, you can DOS the POFMA team eventually.

Do it together with 5 more friends and you can perform DDOS.",NEU
As long as you‚Äôre an enemy of the incumbent ruling party anything you say can be made to be false,NEG
"~~MinLaw~~ A ministry headed by Shanmugam laid out several clarifications on Mr Lee‚Äôs false statements in its press release on Tuesday.

The conflicts of interest never ends.",NEU
I've got fomo. Everyone pofma but me üò≠,NEU
"omg at first i thought LHY became a minister.

&gt;***Government ministers will issue*** instructions to correct falsehoods through an appointed Competent Authority, as laid out in Section 6",NEG
"Once again, the government misses the reason why people are outraged over the ridout saga. LHY states the facts here. So what if the ministers did everything by the book, the fact that one of them was even allowed to rent properties from the agencies he controls is concerning and LHY has every right to bring them up. 
And so what if it was SPH that inflated the circulation numbers, not SPH Media Trust, it doesn‚Äôt matter.
Use POFMA for real fake news please not this type of minor technicalities",NEG
Okay... here's a question... if the opposition want more info on how the gahmen is ran. Could they just anyhow hentam any cock and bull story regularly and see which one kena POFMA and which ones dont? Hit grass frighten snake.,NEG

There‚Äôs a reason why K Shanmugam is the head of Pofma division. He can interpret things the correct way where no one else can. So be patient while he interprets it and let you understand how to interpret the situation.,POS
