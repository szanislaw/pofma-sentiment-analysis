LMAO. Is this MOMs and MHAs new job scope? To issue POFMAs left right and centre? Fooking lame.
"Dorms: On fire 

Foreign Workers: Confined

PMETS: PHV / Food Delivery Riders 

MOM: POFMA ALL THE WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYY"
"It’s a facebook post from 2019.. just live and let live wtf, nobody would have remembered that post otherwise until MOM decided to bring it up like a toxic ex digging up your past"
OK. The timing of this POFMA (right after the court's ruling) and the time for which this POFMA is issued on (a post made more than two years ago) is making MOM (or its minister) look VERY petty
"excellent use of time by ministry

anyone else  rmb when we mocked americans for suing for everything that their court system was swamped with frivolous lawsuits"
"Actions like these are why I believe the party is fighting much more for itself than for us Singaporeans...and who can blame them, it's everyone for themselves and altruism is rare..."
MOM spending more time on POFMA than on actually improving workers' lives.
Why this new Pofma order only after Court of Appeal's ruling?
MOM should just pofma the court for their factual error
"Whilst I'm befuddled how is this even remotely possible, there's an infographic that I saw on this case on @sdpmyt on IG that cleared air a little, at least in my case.

It's terrible that the minister dictates what's right and what's wrong because life isn't grey and white, what more that of a minister that is unable to take dissent views?"
"&gt; # MOM issues new Pofma order to SDP after Court of Appeal’s ruling

&gt; SINGAPORE — The Minister for Manpower (MOM) said on Friday night (8 October) it has issued a new Correction Direction (CD) under the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act 2019 (Pofma) to the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) over a false statement of fact in SDP’s 2 December 2019 Facebook post.

&gt; The move comes after the Court of Appeal’s (CA) judgment on SDP’s appeal in relation to three CDs issued to the opposition party on 14 December 2019. The CDs pertained to falsehoods on SDP’s Facebook posts and an article on its website titled “SDP Population Policy: Hire S’poreans First, Retrench S’poreans last”.

&gt; The subject statement identified in three of the CDs was “Local PMET retrenchment has been increasing” (first subject statement). An additional subject statement identified in the third CD was “Local PMET employment has gone down” (second subject statement).

&gt; The SDP applied to the High Court, and thereafter appealed to the CA to set aside the CDs. The CA upheld all three CDs in respect of the first subject statement, and dismissed the SDP’s appeal in this regard.

&gt; The CA allowed a part of the SDP’s appeal with respect to the third CD regarding the second subject statement. This is because the CA found that the term “Local PMET employment” used in the infographic in SDP’s 2 December 2019 Facebook is understood as referring only to Singapore citizen professional, manager, executive and technician (PMETs), instead of both Singapore citizens and permanent residents.

&gt; In a statement on 14 December 2019 regarding the three CDs against SDP, MOM wrote then, “On 2 December 2019, SDP published a sponsored Facebook post, which contains a graphical illustration depicting plunging local PMET employment. This is wrong. As reported in the Ministry of Manpower’s Comprehensive Labour Force Survey, local PMETs employment has risen steadily since 2015.”

&gt; In its statement on Friday, MOM said, “However, even if we consider only the employment of Singapore citizens in PMET jobs, SDP’s statement that such employment has gone down is still completely false. The number of Singapore citizens employed in PMETs jobs has increased steadily from 2015 to 2019.”

&gt; As such, the Minister for Manpower has asked the POFMA Office to issue a CD to the SDP in relation to this false statement of fact found in SDP’s 2 December 2019 Facebook post, MOM added.
