11pm on a Saturday night… another poor civil servant have to OT
"TJC again trying to argue that due process was not given...

I mean fight against the DP but coming up with all these misinformation isn't going to help your case"
Should they not name all the office bearers of TJC. 3 POFMA and Singaporeans have no clue. Our media is also useless.
"I cringe everytime MHA uses this argument when justifying death penalty for drug trafficking.

&gt;“It is also noteworthy that TJC had chosen to highlight the drug trafficker’s side of the story, while ignoring the fact that he had committed the crime for personal financial gain and **disregarded the harms he would cause to his victims** – the drug abusers and their loved ones,” the ministry added.

Because this exact argument can be used against every single law in singapore that DOES NOT contain death penalty, when you make ""think of the victim"" argument to justify a tough law. People will start questioning why the same tough law isn't applied to other crimes that cause harm to their respective victims. Does this mean the victims of other crimes matter less than drug addicts and their families?

Feels like MHA just want to use the ""think of the victim"" to guilt trip people who argues against DP for drug trafficking but does not realise that it makes other victims of other crimes ""worth less"" since no DP."
"I am for death penalty against drug traffickers.

It should seriously deter people from committing the crimes, even if the monetary reward is huge.

This TJC probably had someone who was executed and felt the need to push for no death penalty, meaning it was a personal Vendetta not a greater cause."
"Why do we have so many people who think trouble-making can be a professional sport? 

Just eat your buns and stop being edgy ffs"
