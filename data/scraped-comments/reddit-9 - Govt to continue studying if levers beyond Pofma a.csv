META says hi
Govt learning from barca
Facebook is serving me deepfake sponsored ads of local politicians and actors daily.
"Basically headline says ""Govt *will* implement further levers beyond POFMA."""
"The answer is a resounding yes. Look at what happened to LHL recently. 

That deepfake video of him was quite the masterpiece."
We also need to find a way to tackle those ai filters on social media. I reckon I won’t like 90% of content I consume if filters didn’t exist lol
They will just decide what is fake now
"What stupid levers do they need? They just need to promote the use of a robust system of digital identity/signing/verification. To guard against fakes, everything important needs to be signed with the digital identity, including recordings of speeches. You can fake a video or audio recording but you can't fake a digital signature unless you steal the key.

But implementing more things in the spirit of POFMA gives them more control. All political parties and states crave control."
