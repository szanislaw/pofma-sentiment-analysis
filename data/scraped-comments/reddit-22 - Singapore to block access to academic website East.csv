"If you can't beat them, ban them."
Really have too much time on their hands to be going after stuff like this. Draws more attention to it then if untouched.
East Asia Forum mostly sources commentary from academics and is a pretty useful resource for getting a closer look at current affairs across east asia/sea. This just screams of insecurity.
"When POFMAs are enforced but ignored - such as in this case - &amp; the websites are blocked, who exactly is being punished? The readers or the sites?"
Reeks of small peepee energy from the Govt
Use a VPN. None of these blocking shenanigans will bother you.
"Real idiotic IMO.
What is this? China?

Let people decide what is wrong and right themselves! Sacred what?"

SINGAPORE: Internet service providers in Singapore will be ordered to block access to Australia-based academic website East Asia Forum, after the platform failed to comply with a correction direction by the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) Office.

The Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) announced this on Saturday (Sep 16), three days after the POFMA order was issued to East Asia Forum.

“The Access Blocking Orders require internet access service providers to disable access for end-users in Singapore to the East Asia Forum’s website, where the falsehoods are communicated,” MCI said.

The POFMA order relates to claims made in an article titled ""A spate of scandals strikes Singapore"", written by Dr Ying-Kit Chan from the National University of Singapore.

The article contains false statements on matters such as the independence of the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's approach in addressing extramarital affairs among parliamentarians, the Prime Minister's Office said on Wednesday.

Under the POFMA order, East Asia Forum is required to publish a correction notice at the top of the article and the website’s main page.

East Asia Forum has not done so as of 12.30pm on Saturday. It had posted a link instead to a government statement at the end of the article's comment section, at the bottom of the website.

“Should East Asia Forum subsequently comply with the full requirements of the Correction Direction, the minister will cancel the Access Blocking Orders,” MCI said.

Separately, Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office Indranee Rajah has instructed the POFMA Office to issue a targeted correction direction to Facebook’s Meta Platforms over the East Asia Forum article.

Meta will be required to publish a correction notice to Facebook users in Singapore accessing the East Asia Forum post on Aug 18 which shared the article.

The last time Singapore moved to block an online publication for failing to comply with a POFMA order was in June, after Asia Sentinel did not carry a correction notice according to requirements.

The Ministry of Home Affairs said in May that the Asia Sentinel article, which contained an interview with the author of a 2021 commentary criticising Singapore's handling of KTV lounges amid the COVID-19 pandemic, contained several falsehoods.

The California-registered publication remains blocked in Singapore.

Might as well have our own great firewall like china. At least can keep scammers out.
Lame.
POFMA is a joke
Gov: I don't want friend with you liao
"I'm curious about A/P Chan's ""government’s mismanagement of the COVID-19 pandemic"", in what way did SG Gov mismanaged the COVID pandemic? I thought we did a pretty good job?

Further investigation reveals that his research was or is being funded by external entities.

Not so simple it seems?"
Use a VPN. Don’t let people in positions of power tell you what you can or cannot read. Form your own judgement whether sometime is a fact or an opinion
A chance to see how effective is such a blockage.
Time to vpn and add to list of favourite sites
VPN go brrrrrr
"So many words in the article yet without details of the content of the POFMA order.

People still use ISP dns?
That gonna make reddit angry.
"Ok but tbf i read the original article, the arguments are quite flawed, making quite a few broad assumptions and using logical fallacies.

&gt;Lee said publicly that he personally approved the probe of Iswaran, meaning that he had the capacity to refuse approval.

CPIB doesn’t actually need ah Loong’s permission to investigate. Report to him is like courtesy only. So yeah he can refuse approval, but it wouldn’t change anything if CPIB die die want investigate. (Of course this is predicated that CPIB officers have the moral courage to stir this kind of shit)

All in all, the whole article read like gossip. Something you would expect to find on a FB shitpost from the usual political siao langs, not from an academic.

IMO, EAF should bite the bullet and just issue the correction or better yet remove the article. It literally does not add any value lol."
