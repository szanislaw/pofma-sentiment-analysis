POFMA recursion
So meta.
"Of all things, I am surprised PJ Thum didn't bring up the legitimate point of chilling effects, where journalists self-censor for fear of a POFMA directive. This could make government criticism muted even if it can never be censored by the state.

That is unless assurance is given of no legal consequences for those who accidentally publish falsehoods."
"&gt; # S'pore historian PJ Thum &amp; New Naratif issued with POFMA orders over 'false &amp; misleading' video on POFMA

&gt; Minister for Home Affairs and Law K Shanmugam has issued Correction Directions under the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) to online publication New Naratif and historian Thum Ping Tjin, also known as PJ Thum.

&gt; According to a Ministry of Law press release dated May 13, Thum made several false and misleading statements on the Act.

&gt; These statements were made on a video posted to the New Naratif YouTube channel. Thum is the Managing Director of New Naratif, according to its website.

&gt; PJ Thum: POFMA and its failings

&gt; In his video, Thum touched on ""POFMA and its failings as a law"" and went on to use POFMA as an example of how laws are allegedly ""created and abused in Singapore"".

&gt; In particular, Thum made four points which the Singapore government took issue with:

&gt; POFMA's definition of a falsehood is too broad and because of this, ""every statement can be considered false in some way"". POFMA makes all criticisms of the Government illegal. There is no recourse in law for the Court to overturn a POFMA direction if it is an abuse of the powers under POFMA. Under POFMA, ""the truth will be whatever the [ruling party] says it is"".

&gt; In a rebuttal posted on Factually, the government fact-checker site:

&gt; The Courts have developed criteria for assessing falsehoods and can determine if a statement is false or not. POFMA also only applies to factual statements, not criticism nor opinions. ""Before and after POFMA came into force, there have been criticisms of the Government (including by Mr Thum), on a regular basis. They have not been the subject of POFMA."" The Courts have judicial oversight of the exercise of powers under POFMA. Orders issued under POFMA are done by the government, not a party.

&gt; Addressing Thum's points

&gt; The government also provided a rather detailed clarification on several other points made in Thum's video about whether POFMA was used inconsistently, the time taken for an appeal, and the claim about past PAP governments using misinformation to silence critics, among others.

&gt; Under the Correction Directions, a correction notice must be placed alongside the YouTube video. This notice will include a link to ""the facts and the Government’s clarifications on the matter"", said the Ministry of Law.

&gt; ""The video itself will remain fully accessible to the public,"" said the ministry, adding that members of the public can view the video, read the correction notice and clarifications, and come to their own conclusions.

"I mean, come on, I don't really think much of PJ Thum but you should read [the POFMA correction](https://www.gov.sg/article/factually-corrections-on-falsehoods-about-pofma-by-thum-ping-tjin) for yourself. At best it's nitpicking and at worst it's disingenuous.

The law plainly states that a statement is false ""if it is false or misleading, whether wholly or in part.""

How then is Thum incorrect for saying ""even if one bit is found to be wrong or misleading, the whole statement can be considered false""? He's not saying that one bit of falsehood *always* taints the whole statement; he's saying the law leaves open that possibility. 

There's also nonsense like how the SDP case wasn't actually about the ""interpretation of statistical data."" Not the whole thing, maybe, but a big part of it was. [The High Court spends many pages dissecting the statistics starting on p.37 of their ruling](https://www.supremecourt.gov.sg/docs/default-source/module-document/judgement/-2020-sghc-25-pdf.pdf).

The rest of the correction notice is interspersed with this kind of ""clarification."" Look at the Li Shengwu part, for example. The government [asked a court](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/apex-court-grants-permission-for-li-shengwu-to-appeal-against-service-of-contempt-papers) to retroactively apply a rule, codified by the Administration of Justice (Protection) Act in 2018, so that they could serve papers on Li Shengwu. Thum simplifies this to say that the government tried to apply the 2018 law retroactively. The government say they didn't try to do that. Maybe a lawyer can jump in, but this seems like a technical distinction at best.

The only silver lining is that the government has issued only a correction notice and not a take-down order, so you can view the [PJ Thum video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWjPx48lRVM) for yourself. I don't appreciate his snarky attitude but the video makes good, fair points.

Watch the video, read the government's correction notice, search for the facts yourself, reach your own conclusion. But if you're anything like me you'll be flabbergasted at how absurd the correction notice is."
"He might be right, but I do not trust a historian who asked mathathir the great democrat to bring democracy to Singapore not to mention the suspicious ties of his new naratif with Soros."
"Thanks POFMA, I'll be giving his video a gander now."
"* POFMA makes all criticisms of the Government illegal.
* There is no recourse in law for the Court to overturn a POFMA direction if it is an abuse of the powers under POFMA.  


These 2 claims are too CSB.

If POFMA makes all criticisms of the government is illegal then all the opposition political party members, some SPH reporters would have been POFMA-ed

&amp;#x200B;

Also you can go to court to overturn a POFMA directive so there is recourse in the law. Of course whether you will get it is another thing"
Why does this chap look so smug all the time?
PJ Thum is a disgrace
"This PJ Thum clearly has malicious intent, as shown by his comments on Singapore and Malaysia in recent years. Better watch out, cut from the same cloth as Lim Tean and CSJ."
“historian”
"Need to be very careful that all three of New Naratif's readers aren't misled.

edit: oh no all three of them downvoted me"

POFMA ensures only the right news is published. POFMA is the way for the world and SG and show the world how we punch above our weight in press correctness and accuracy.
"He claims to have a PhD. I say he has permanent head damage.

He can dress in his atas suits, whatever he prefers. At the end of the day, apart from his motley crew of 100 or so fellow PhDs, no one in Singapore gives a flying damn about this smug action kia!"
