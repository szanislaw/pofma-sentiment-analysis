I wonder if someone creates an AI botnet one day and churn out ridiculous local online articles daily and whether pofma office is going to deal with each and every one of them as diligently as now against selected people.
"The dumb thing the administration keeps doing is wasting their ammo on frivolous pedantic POFMAs, that Singaporeans don't take POFMAs of more serious and insidious cases misinformation as serious as they should. It's a classic boy who cried wolf tale.

People are jaded, they only have so much intellectual bandwidth and their reservoirs of patience can only be drained so much."

"Title: Pofma order issued to Kenneth Jeyaretnam over comments about money laundering, other recent issues  

SINGAPORE – Reform Party leader Kenneth Jeyaretnam has been issued a third correction direction under the law against fake news, this time over comments made in social media posts about three issues recently in the news.

They are the arrests of 10 foreign nationals during an islandwide anti-money laundering blitz, the corruption probe into Transport Minister S. Iswaran and Mr Ong Beng Seng, and the Ridout Road property rentals by Minister for Law and Home Affairs K. Shanmugam and Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan.

The Ministry of Law (MinLaw) said on Tuesday that Second Minister for Law Edwin Tong issued the instruction under the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (Pofma) to Mr Jeyaretnam.

He is required to put up correction notices on the posts he made on Facebook and X, formerly known as Twitter, on Aug 18.

Mr Jeyaretnam falsely stated that the arrests of 10 foreign nationals on Aug 15 for forgery and money laundering offences were a result of China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi, and China, putting pressure on Singapore.

“As stated in the police news release on Aug 16, they had identified the suspects through intelligence probes and extensive investigations including the analysis of suspicious transaction reports,” said MinLaw.

“These operations and the planning of the arrests had been in the works over many months. They were not at the behest or because of any foreign party.”

MinLaw added that no foreign parties had been informed of these cases before the arrests.

In his post, Mr Jeyaretnam also made the false statement that the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) probe into Mr Iswaran and Mr Ong, too, was a result of foreign pressure.

The CPIB had been investigating a separate matter, and came across some information concerning Mr Iswaran, the ministry explained. CPIB then looked into the matter.

These facts were stated publicly on multiple occasions, including in Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Education Minister Chan Chun Sing’s statements in Parliament on Aug 2, CPIB’s press release on July 12, as well as the PM’s statement and Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong’s doorstop interview on the same day, MinLaw added.

Mr Jeyaretnam in his post also said the rental rates paid by Mr Shanmugam and Mr Balakrishnan for 26 and 31 Ridout Road, respectively, were locked in over nine years, which is untrue.

MinLaw said the tenancies are renewable every two or three years, and the rentals are reviewed based on prevailing market value.

“When the tenancies of the two properties were up for renewal after the initial three years, a revaluation was carried out by professional valuers to peg the rentals to the prevailing market rate,” it added. “This valuation was based on market comparables.”
