"I like how on the factually website, they never actually quote what was said, but instead ""helpfully summarise"" what was written, and then go on to ""debunk"" this new version of what was said"
"CNA is such a propaganda tabloid media outlet nowadays. It quoted factually's statements, yet it intentionally refused to provide links to JB's articles or quote his exact words. What a scammy media outlet."
"The Ridout road portion is pure comedy.

POFMA = Political opposition fixing by manipulation always haha
There's no legal limit of how many POFMA one can get right?

Protection OF my ass?
His father's son!
Can't he just stop spouting falsehoods for a change? Or is this the only way he can make his political rivals look bad?
Kenny Boy! You are drunk again! Go home!
Orbi good. Zero tolerance for fake news from 5th-rate politicians.
"Apples never falls far from the tree I see....

Someone evidently and absolutely did NOT learn anything from his father's mistakes...

I applaud the jeyaretnams' passion, their political tact though, not so much....

There are ways to play the political game in Singapore....and one of them is basically, never do what the Jayaretnams did."
