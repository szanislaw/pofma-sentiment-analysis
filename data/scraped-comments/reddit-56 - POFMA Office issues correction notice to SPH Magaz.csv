"Wow, this is the first time I see the government taking action on EDMW bui-buis for spreading fake news.

Usually ""sagas"" are left to run wild in EDMW, like they are some bastion of free speech in Singapore (aside from kopitiams and taxis)."
if only they can do something about those aunties whatsapp forward messages. but POFMA cannot do anything if they do not know the originator

"Soon, there will be so many POFMA notice that new ones issued aren't newsworthy."
Wow the law is used appropriately for once
This is a potential crisis and fear mongering needs to be addressed. Good application. It’s also a warning to the Mods and owner to keep tabs.
YES now this is what POFMA should be used for. Not graphs and not the idle ramblings of Lim Tean.
Got to say the moderating standards there are a complete joke.

"
Even with the outsourcing of community moderators, SPH still can’t make money online."
"What are mods doing there, not acting fast to delete fake news?    Many posts i read there have posters banned out of no where reasonable for ban.   Mods not doing the right thing when needed like this case on fake news to take it down immediately.  Looks very much the mods in the cesspool abuse their power on ban .  Time for sph to revamp mod team. 

Have not thought of signing up there.  Low grade posters and unprofessional, bias abusive mods."
