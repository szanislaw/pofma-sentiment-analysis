"There must be something more going on with PSP. I don't think POFMA itself is a political death sentence but it seems like there may be internal in-fighting and this may be the last straw. LMW never had the confidence of his CEC anyway. 

This reeks of bad political instincts and its not good for party solidarity to do something like this in a potential election year."
"Wah, that means Hazel Poa will become the first female secretary-general of a political party in Singapore?

EDIT: Oops, forgot she was in NSP. :("
Dr Chee be sweating right now
"Wah is this really that serious that he has to step down as PSP chief? If our politicians step down after each POFMA order, I think we really got no more opposition left after 1 election cycle lol."
Obviously something else happening in the party. POFMA is just an excuse to get rid of him.
"Not sure if it’s a power struggle or whatever but on the surface this might actually be good for LMW. He looks responsible for “taking accountability” for his mistake, it plays into his underdog role about being “bullied” by the PAP with their endless pofmas, and no one who supports PSP will care about him being Sec Gen or not.

He still remains an NCMP, still the most recognisable PSP face in Singapore, nothing much will change for him."
that's harsh. did dr tan force him to step down?
"You guys realise that there is an interesting pattern with the ages of the PSP Sec-Gens? 

1st Sec-Gen - Tan Chen Bock - 80s

2nd Sec-Gen - Francis Yuen - 70s

3rd Sec-Gen - Leong Mun Wai - 60s

4th Sec-Gen - Hazel Poa - 50s

So, likely by 2026, they will have the youngest ever party leader in Singapore."
The old couple screwed him upside down.
Lol. Rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic
"Byebye. 

Talks without thinking sometimes, but he does have the guts to raise the uncomfortable questions in parliament sometimes.

Hazel Poa has the brains and eloquence to bring them forward"
"Huh. Totally didn't expect this.  
  
He was building up to be one of the faces of the PSP, as much as some of it wasn't for great reasons. Wonder what's happening internally in PSP... doubt it has much to do with him getting the POFMA as stated."
"Foreigner here... and an Indian national at that, fwiw

I've had my reservations about LMW bringing coffee shop uncle conversations to parliament... but bring it he did. And in a weird way, I gotta respect him for that. The dude channeled street energy into an elitist space, and got the scholars ducking for cover.

A good chunk of parliamentary discussions in 2021 and 2022 wouldn't have happened if LMW hadn't spoken up. I don't like him for bringing in imho frankly bs nativist rhetoric, but I gotta give him points for gumption.

Parliamentary sessions aren't going to be the same without him."
I think the entire PSP party was a clown show other than Hazel Poa. Good move to make her the new SEC gen.
"when your opponent is the Nintendo DS, being the playstation portable is bound to lose.."
"More like take responsibility for all the gaffes and other hilariously embarrassing mistakes till date.

It's far from the first time he anyhow tia gong and shot himself in the foot."
Lol
"Though he has good intentions he has become a lose cannon. There is a responsibility to do some basic level of due diligence but in this case he was taken for a long ride by a couple. 

PSP is not in disarray. They already has a wave of resignations before the last elections and with TKL and now this, not sure if they can keep their head above water."
Another display of internal PSP chaos. 4 secretary generals in just 5 years
That seems overly harsh
Unwise move by their party.
"Should have stepped down earlier.. Xenophobic guy.. And best, endorsed by TCB"
Step down as chief only right?  he's still with PSP and still a NCMP right?  I think they're just trying to show accountability.
Will he be moving to the Steam Deck or Nintendo Switch party next?
I thought the POFMA action was overblown. This one takes the cake
"politics is a dirty game afterall, he's too naive to play it"
"Leong Mun Wai is not much of a speaker but he has gumption and morals, which is what we need more of in parliament."
"No need to take this seriously. When he wins West Coast grc, he will be back as Sec Gen again. Nothing is permanent"
