"POFMA is absurd. At this rate, it is becoming low key illegal to open your mouth unless you are a lawyer."
"Splitting hairs, pofma is a waste of taxpayers money"
Yes but who really listens to who. Stop playing word games. In prohibited area - race also can change to suit eligibility. Decision not made by minister but told to do so.Â

"Pofma here, Pofma there. Might as well do away with erection and just declare dictatorship once and for all. Don't waste people's time and money with all the unnecessary and silly wayang."
"Weather v hot. stultifying even.
Go settle Iswaran case 1st??bef launching ano. Pofma
We almost  can't take it anymore"
"It seems SDP is trying to make up for lost ground, to compete with the other Opposition parties in terms of number of POFMA collections. Can't they focus on winning any parliamentary seats for once?"
