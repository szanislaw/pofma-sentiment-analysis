"POFMA has shown me the way. I have since learnt that if there is no POFMA, it is 100% true, because of how liberally it is used."
Basically POFMA used everywhere except on the incumbents.
"still waiting for pofma to be applied to the financial times for supposedly publishing false info about MAS, and today for publishing ""miselading"" info about NAC. 

after all, pofma is about correcting false information  and not undermining the credibility of the target right?"
Political weapon?
Cannot comment later kena pofma
Time to pofma the Mark Lee ads
Some have been Pofmatised.
"Many people miss one big point about POFMA...

It's to give chance to the publisher/writer because the alternative would be legal action.

Most will get away with just the POFMA but sometimes they don't.

"What everyone seems to miss in these discussions of POFMA, is that the original post is not taken down.

It's a right of reply from the government placed in the same space that the article was published.

If people don't like it, they are free to read the original article and disregard the govt's rebuttal."
