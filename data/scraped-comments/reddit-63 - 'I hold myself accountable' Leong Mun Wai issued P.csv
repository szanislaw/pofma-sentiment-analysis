Good reply. Probably the best move he can make at this point.
"Lmw is steady to admit he got smoked, that is the right way to gain confidence."
Better recovery than WP’s shitshow. LMW was trying to do the right thing when he was being smoked left right and centre.
"This is the classiest response from LMW.

Issuing a POFMA notice because LMW posted a story he heard first hand from the couple, what a bunch of fucking clowns.

All the ministry had to do was to contact LMW privately to clarify the matter, but they chose to be petty and shame him on national media, when all he wanted to do was share the plight of residents."
"LMW 敢做敢当, better than iswaran still denying"
Applaudable move
Good response. Make PAP looks petty issuing POFMAs left and right.
Owning up to one’s mistakes. I see heart. That’s good.
LMW just gave a huge middle finger to PAP and showing that POFMA is abused free flow by the PAP. Not every POFMA is done in good intentions.
A Singapore politician taking accountability? I’ve seen it all
"This is what makes a man, a man - The ability to own up to his fallabilities."
"LMW, the man walking his talk."
"this guy, he's a real man. admit his mistake."
Good reply. Probably will be forgotten in a few weeks time
"""I hold myself accountable"", means LMW just sort of indirectly apologised and removed the Facebook post and that's it liao."
pap is a sinking ship. they will play dirty to sink others instead of improving themselves. in the first place why couple is in distress?? because of.....???
"If LMW truly learn his lesson, he should request some form of documents from the couple to support his case, reassure them that he will check and bring it up for attention and follow through if it's genuine.

That is accountability. Not say say then retract his statements."
Shouldn't the focus be on the couple? Were they ownself IB or PAP saboteurs sent in to mislead and torpedo the opposition? I will not be surprised if a supporter ownself did this so PAP can ownself claim 'don't know' through plausible deniability.
Maybe the day would come when u see the calibre of the new candidates of our incumbent party
Accountability from a Singapore politician? The arrogance of this feller trying to spoil market. Watch how PAP takes him out.
