    If a Government wants to break their own laws and trace votes just to oppress people, they can, the serial numbers make it physically possible to trace votes. However, the procedures of handling the ballot papers make it nearly impossible to do so without getting caught or called out, at which point they'll have to resign due to lack of election integrity, or be like Belarus. Neither scenario has ever played out.

    Some of the comments here are quite alarming, as is the insinuation that vote-tracing could take place for improper purposes. If, indeed, the government were capable of ""penalising"" certain voters, opposition candidates would be up in arms. Instead, some -- recognising that electoral secrecy is in the interests of everyone -- have rightly affirmed that electoral secrecy in Singapore is robust: in the context of Parliamentary elections, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDeIFUw1K1o or the video posted by the Workers' Party on Facebook titled ""Your Vote Is Secret"".

    The government's statement referred to a ""chain of custody"". If you want more details, see the Presidential Elections Act 1991, sections 31 to 32B. In short, at all times, the ballot boxes are either in view of candidates' representatives, or sealed by all candidates or their agents ""in such manner that the box or boxes cannot be opened and nothing can be inserted therein without breaking the seals"" (s 31(2)). For examples (again, in the context of Parliamentary elections), see https://mothership.sg/2021/01/ge-2020-ballot-papers-destroyed/ and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67bQf71kts0

    In a statement on Friday, the Elections Department (ELD), which falls under the Prime Minister’s Office, said TikTok user dr.ishhaq.jay had in a post on July 17 falsely claimed that the Government is able to trace votes back to the voter in order to penalise them.

    The contention isn't that the govt can trace votes to voters (they can, in exceptional circumstances, by court order, for instance when there is reasonable suspicion of widespread voter fraud)
  ",neutral

    Does the govt have ability to trace votes back to individual voters?
  ",neutral

    Yes.
  ",neutral

    Will they be able to do it in a non-public manner to pinpoint your specific votes?

    Probably no. Also why would they risk it to find out how you vote? lmao

    There’s a case where the government might be interested, in aggregate, how new citizens from various countries/demographics vote.  The benign reason would be to prevent capture of our state via the ballot box, the malignant one would be to favour immigrants that vote the incumbent.
  ",neutral

    Perhaps there’s some psyops team somewhere monitoring this.  Although I’m not sure if this would be more effective than simply doing an exit poll of new citizens.

    However, since we don’t have any obviously overt parties that are strongly in favour of foreign interference (unlike Ukraine before the war) I doubt the utility of this method of propaganda anyway.

    Title: Pofma order issued to TikToker over false claims Govt can trace votes to voters
  ",negative
"
    SINGAPORE – A TikTok user has been issued a correction notice under the law against fake news, for a post on the social media platform that contained false claims regarding vote secrecy.
  ",negative
"
    In a statement on Friday, the Elections Department (ELD), which falls under the Prime Minister’s Office, said TikTok user dr.ishhaq.jay had in a post on July 17 falsely claimed that the Government is able to trace votes back to the voter in order to penalise them.
  ",neutral
"
    The correction order was issued by the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (Pofma) office under the instruction of Minister-in-Charge of the Public Service and Education Minister Chan Chun Sing.
  ",neutral
"
    A statement on Government fact-checking website Factually gave the following explanation as to why the claims were false:
  ",neutral
"
    – The Parliamentary Elections Act 1954 (PEA), and the equivalent provisions of its predecessor Acts, provide for voting secrecy. The Government and ELD have complied strictly with the statutory procedures and obligations relating to voting secrecy, as a matter of policy and practice.
  ",neutral
"
    – The statutory procedures and obligations to protect voting secrecy are rigorous and comprehensive. For example, every officer, clerk, interpreter, candidate and agent authorised to attend at a polling station or at the counting of votes must, before so attending, make an oath of secrecy.
  ",neutral
"
    – Another set of statutory procedures provide that, for votes cast in person at polling stations, there is no break in the chain of custody of ballot papers transported from the polling stations to the counting centres, and from the counting centres to the Supreme Court.
  ",neutral
"
    The ballot papers would be sealed before they are retained in safe custody at the Supreme Court for six months and subsequently destroyed. This process is transparent and open to observation by candidates and their agents.
  ",neutral
"
    – The serial number on the ballot paper is meant to protect the integrity of the electoral process. It enables accounting of all ballot papers issued and cast, and safeguards against counterfeiting and voter impersonation. Calling out the voter’s serial number and name also allows polling agents, who are observing the proceedings, to validate that the voters are listed in their copy of the register.
  ",neutral
"
    – When the ballot paper is issued, the voter serial number is written on the ballot paper counterfoil to facilitate vote tracing, if necessary, for example if there are allegations that the vote was fraudulently cast. However, inspection of the sealed votes is allowed only with an order from the General Division of the High Court, and such an order can only be made in limited circumstances.
  ",neutral
"
    The Judge hearing the application must be satisfied that the inspection is required for the purposes of instituting or maintaining a prosecution or an application under Section 90 of the PEA, which seeks to void an election on certain limited grounds, including breaches of the PEA that affected the election result or corrupt or illegal practices committed in the election by a candidate.
  ",neutral
"
    Therefore, the Government cannot trace who a voter has voted for, as it wishes, the Factually article concludes.
  ",neutral
"
    Under the correction notice, dr.ishhaq.jay will be required to create a new TikTok post which states that his earlier post contained a false statement, and also provide a link to the Government’s clarification.
  ",neutral
"
    TikTok itself was also issued a targeted correction direction, in relation to the post by dr.ishhaq.jay, which stipulates that a correction notice be sent to all Tiktok users in Singapore who had accessed the post.
