    “Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean also said that Minister K Shanmugam had recused himself, and this meant that he no longer had any duty in the matter. There could thus be no potential or actual conflict of interest.”The senior minister also explained how Mr Shanmugam had “removed himself from the chain of command and decision-making process entirely” when it came to the rental of 26 Ridout Road.

    Hey team, big boss has removed himself from the decision-making process of this house he's going to rent. Remember to make the decisions as if you don't know he's the tenant, okay?

    Jom also claimed the SLA spent more than S$1 million (US$0.76 million) on the renovation of both bungalows because the ministers were tenants.

    vs what was actually written:

"
    In Parliament, Balakrishnan and Shanmugam cried about the sacrifices they made moving into apparently decrepit bungalows. Stories of termites and financial losses, respectively, merited a sandiwara soundtrack. The bare facts are shocking, including over S$1m of taxpayer money spent on renovation works.

    does that sound like a fair characterisation? why only provide their own interpretation of what was said, instead of quoting directly from the article itself?

    LMAO, so now if you do an article, you need to make sure you don't miss out a single line that Teo Chee Hean (which, just a reminder, is an involved person in the Ridout affair and shouldn't even be talking from a point of authority) said?

    2 MPs cum Ministers elected by the people of Singapore some of whom are in low income brackets are renting prime state owned properties and one is huge, half the size of the Padang. It would reasonable to state that it is a lavish lifestyle reminiscent of days of the British Raj. And certainly in conflict with the spartan image that the ruling govt  projects of itself with its trademark short sleeves and white top and bottom with no ties or suits.
