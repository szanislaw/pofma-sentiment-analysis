    SINGAPORE — Barely two months after a controversial piece of legislation on fake news took effect on 2 October, the Singapore government struck with lightning speed by throwing the book at one politician, followed by two political parties and a website and demanding corrections to what the government calls misleading information.
  ",negative

    An examination of two of the cases shows the government is going into the grey areas of the legislation. Despite assurances that opinions are okay, opposition politician Brad Bowyer’s blog post claiming that the government has a say in the investment decisions of GIC and Temasek Holdings makes one wonder what is actually an opinion.
  ",neutral
"
    Arguments can be mounted either way. It is not an opinion because Bowyer’s assertion cannot be proven and so fails the test of law. It is an opinion because he drew a conclusion from the fact that the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister are the chairman and deputy chairman respectively of GIC and a former senior minister, Lim Boon Heng, is the chairman of Temasek. Both opinions have different shades of the truth, for sure.
  ",neutral
"
    But Bowyer’s case was weakened because he did not get his facts right on Singapore’s stake in helping to build a new capital city for the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh and Temasek’s investment in a debt-laden company. Reality check: Get all your facts right if you want to maintain the credibility of your arguments and opinions.

    Opposition politician Lim Tean’s point that foreign tertiary students get the lion’s share of government bursaries and scholarships can be debated till one reaches the cul de sac. The government insists that the Lim Team statement does not give the full story as it doesn’t factor in many other monetary benefits that Singapore students get.
  ",neutral

    I would argue that commentators and politicians need to be balanced and responsible when they write and speak. Also, they need to ask what kind of impression their points of view leave behind with the reader. Lim Tean fails this test, but marking his post as fake news does not fit the spirit of the law as Law Minister K Shanmugam has taken pains in the run-up to its implementation to emphasise that it is narrow in scope.
  ",neutral

    The other two cases are easier to deal with. The Singapore Democratic Party’s post that more PMETs have been retrenched have been shown be not true. And for the party to say that they got the information from The Straits Times just doesn’t cut it. The guiding principle must be to always go to the source – in this case, the Ministry of Manpower.

    The fourth example is the States Times Review which, true to form, deserved to be shamed. It has always been mischievous in its content and its latest was no different. So why bother to call it out? Knowing full well that the publisher, in the safety of Australia, cannot be punished, the target had to be Facebook as the article was posted on its platform.

    Where does this leave the government and its war on fake news?
  ",negative
"
    One, it will go all the way to define fake news very narrowly. It can go after those who write opinion articles even if they are based on some facts, but not the full facts. 
  ",negative
"
    Two, the government will always win because it has all the facts, many of them not in the public domain, and will use them to prove that it is right. 
  ",neutral
"
    Three, proving your point can be impossible. In Bowyer’s case, there is no evidence of government interference in GIC and Temasek’s decisions. Inference alone is not going to get you anywhere.
  ",negative
"
    With elections round the corner and with the first few actions by the government raising questions, it might be the right time for those fingered to test the decisions in court.

    Which shows his knowledge is only within the media realm and not able to critically engage the concept of truths and half truths in general.

    Balji is clearly biased in the writing, and does not content with the issue of truth being a concept. In the first half of the article, he at least engages with different perspectives on Bowyer's case and also understood the the balancing and nuances of the source citation - this is a more balanced view about the POFMA problem, and teased us with the idea of truth formation, but he does not flesh out the criticality of the concept.
  ",neutral

    But come SDP and Straits Times Review, this is where his biases shows. In which he said going to the source is important for SDP, why does he not question how ST has wrote their articles instead? It is more ironic in a piece about truths, half-truths and opinions that he did not highlight how supposed truths can be manipulated, and even sources can be questioned. Every methodology has its weaknesses and that should be carefully scruitinised as well. This is where we question statistics from collection of data to interpretation. There are numerous discussion about this topic and I'm not going to break everything down, but two widely known issues and quite related to each other, are (1) the problems of different interpretations of one statistic, and (2) the lack of nuances in statistics. That's why we see quantitative researchers sometimes further their researches using qualitative analysis. Balji, in asking where does POFMA stand, does not seem to highlight the problems of POFMA in this case. For Straits Times Review, there's nothing much to say except he's just airing his thoughts from his perspective as a journalist.

    His conclusion however does make logical sense in the foreseeable developments.
  ",positive

    Why do I say this article highlights the problem with technocracy? Because while he's able to understand the situation and POFMA from a media perspective, intrinsically the creation of POFMA and the conceptualization behind it is more of a philosophical foundation before reaching application through legality. The question: what is truth then, is to be scrutinised. This law, just like any other form of strict governmentality and codification, becomes an issue where nuances cannot be in such rigid constructs (See James S Scott for example on how forests and rural areas become codified and disrupt the ecosystems). Coming from a social constructivist perspective, how do we define objectivity should also be scrutinised and cannot use the commonsensical understanding of truths and objectivity, which is why his conclusion makes sense: how POFMA constructs truth in SG can only be understood when the situations materialise.

    I am confused here. The four cases that the articles mention were actually factually incorrect irrespective of whether they were opinions or not. So I don't see why the party accused of misdeeds should not post clarifications justifying its actions. If someone posts something that has been proved to be factually incorrect, albeit retroactively, then they should include a correction highlighting the full details of the new piece of information.
