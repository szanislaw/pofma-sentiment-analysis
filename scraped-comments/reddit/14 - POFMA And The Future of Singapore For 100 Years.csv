"There’s only one problem with POFMA. 

Who will POFMA the POFMAer when the POFMAer talks about half truths or obfuscates the issue?"
"Combined with the control of information, they can always use their data (which is  kept secret btw) to say that what you published is false, without revealing what is true. It may be off by 1¢, and is technically false this way, but we will never know.."
"&gt;The government can use the media to frame the guy as ""untrustworthy"" or ""incompetent"", using the front page to depict ""FALSEHOOD"" beside his face. It can completely zoom in to his mistakes and destroy his entire plan, invalidating every other good argument he has made.

The government do not require POFMA to do this, they just need their media cronies.

POFMA for now is an official direction that compels social media to display the government's side of the story. People are free to read both sides of the story. POFMA does not jail or fine people, though some other laws do."
"Independent body for executing and administrating POFMA or POFMA is removed from the constitution.

Otherwise it is the PAP Only Facts Matter Act. And who knows what other acts the ruling party will enact to the detriment of the electorate."
The legal process against a POFMA thinkin ruling takes 9 days. Campaigning in an election takes 9 days. Coincidence? I think not
"So if the POFMA law when taken to the extreme can be considered the new national security law that have been just implemented in Hong Kong? Where criticism can be mistreated as spreading false information.

What are your guys opinion?"
"I understand what you say, but the truth is majority of people on the ground do not understand all these policies that are implemented and how they are being used until it starts to affect them.  


Just look at CECA, it was implemented in 2005.. took so many years for the citizens to notice and start complaining about it."
