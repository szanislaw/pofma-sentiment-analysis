POFMA is mainly used as it is intended; to shut down discerning narratives especially those which embarrassed the authority.
"A user on this sub tabulated all use of POFMA since its inception leading up to GE2020.

Aside from COVID-19 corrections (mostly to anti-vax nutters), almost all use of POFMA prior to the pandemic was political lol.

Outside of Singapore nobody takes this ""fake news law"" seriously, it sounds like something another authoritarian regime like the Chinese or Saudis would do to be the arbiter of truth."
"Of course abuse cause selective enforcement mean double standard. However, they will tell you no selective enforcement. And basically stuck there. That basically when I made complaint about open burning, everyone tell me is town council's responsibility but town council said they can only advice ppl which is total bullshit. However, matter going no way cause Town council basically act as matter stopper. That why they are more and more crazy ppl taking matter into own hand cause the stress and anger will burst eventually."
"I forgot about the glaring lack of POFMA against the FT despite an outright denial by MAS of what was claimed. one of the parties must be lying, really makes you wonder which..."
The Government has caught itself in a trap of its own devising. It has to POFMA all sorts of trivial inaccuracies just so that it doesn't appear to be tacitly recognising their truth. The proliferation of POFMAs has ironically led to their value being diminished. Every other day there is another POFMA. Yawn.
"No one believes more firmly than Comrade Napoleon that all animals are equal. He would be only too happy to let you make your decisions for yourselves. But sometimes you might make the wrong decisions, comrades, and then where should we be?"
"You guys voted for Mr Nazi there, right?"
Principle abuse
"Ironically, POFMA lets me know the articles I should be reading lol. If an article kena POFMA'ed, then I know it's worth reading. AKA the Streisand effect. So...... Thanks PAP I guess!"
"There was/is long standing cabinet directive that a cabinet minister must take legal action against anyone who has been slandered, defamed etc. It was basically peer group pressure to force less sensitive ministers to do the collective.

With the younger generations and the more online world, lawsuits are largely frowned upon against political opponents, commentators are largely frowned upon. Plus the negative side show that follows the trial. Also there is whole list of  prominent human rights QCs in UK, OZ ready to act pro-bono for the defendants.

So POFMA was introduced. Note an individual Minister again must initiate it, rather than a single watchdog body.

I don't think these Ministers really care if POFMA works. They just want to avoid initiating a damaging lawsuit just to please their colleagues.

But it does stop donations from individuals and bodies when a DOL is issued. Paul Tambyah in the past donated $13k to TOC, so did Janette Aruldoss husband as well as an intermediary body whose director is Tan Wah Piow.

The conundrum is that even if the majority of Singaporeans don't believe the rubbish that Alex Tan of States Times writes from OZ, they click out of curiosity and it provides revenue to Alex. After POFMA DOL, it is now gone. TOC from Taiwan would go down the same route. Asia Sentinel ended up with a blocking order so Singaporeans cant see the content.

But it also created a new mess, the perception of selective enforcement as many don't understand the difference between a damaging opinion piece and a falsehood."
"IIRC, they POFMA some Taiwan news on HC‚Äôs astronomical pay? BUT til today, her pay is still shrouded in secrecy. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
It's so ridiculous that even its pronunciation sounds silly.
Chilling effect.
"I cannot understand the point of this question. 

If you say POFMA is abuse, you will be POFMA'ed. And that will proof what it is, wouldn't it?"
Everything is selectively enforced to a degree. That‚Äôs why we have prosecutorial discretion. It‚Äôs nothing new and not unique to Singapore
