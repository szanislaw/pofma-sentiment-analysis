"idk if it has occurred to them, but the more they POFMA about Ridout Road, the more they keep reminding the public that they are living in palatial grounds where you can‚Äôt even see the house from the main road..."
"Sterra making false claims on pub water: I sleep

KJ comments on Ridout: POFMA"
"The fact remains that one certain elite family stays in a govt house on a prime land parcel of some 250,000 sq ft in a land scarce country. It is probably a mere coincidence that the land is managed by a govt stats board that reports to this same elite. 

Serving countless numbers of profma will not change this fact."
"&gt;Mr Jeyaretnam claimed that the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) had charged ministers K Shanmugam and Vivian Balakrishnan rent at below market value for 26 and 31 Ridout Road respectively, and had given them preferential tenancy terms.


This is just really pathetic quarreling over definitions. KJ is saying ""given the size of the land, the rental is absurdly low and the only people that know that are government officials and anybody bo eng enough to call the SLA hotline"" and the government is saying ""yeah but SLA set it that low so that's the market price."""
"Meanwhile, sterra made massive false claims on PUB water, and advertise their false claims all over social media, yet no POFMA was issued to them.

Clear cut evidence that POFMA is a political tool."
Does the government actually provide evidence or is it just their words against his?
"Title: Kenneth Jeyaretnam given sixth POFMA order over Ridout Road comments 

SINGAPORE: Reform Party leader Kenneth Jeyaretnam has been issued his sixth correction direction under the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) over comments he made on Friday (Feb 16) about the rental of black-and-white bungalows at Ridout Road by two ministers.

Second Minister for Law Edwin Tong had instructed the POFMA order to be issued to Mr Jeyaretnam for his article on The Ricebowl Singapore website, as well as his posts on Facebook, X and LinkedIn.

Correction directions were also issued to Gutzy Asia ‚Äì for an article on its website and its Facebook post ‚Äìas well as The Online Citizen Asia for its Facebook post.

Mr Jeyaretnam claimed that the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) had charged ministers K Shanmugam and Vivian Balakrishnan rent at below market value for 26 and 31 Ridout Road respectively, and had given them preferential tenancy terms.

This claim was also republished by Gutzy Asia and The Online Citizen Asia.

""This is untrue,"" said an article on the government's Factually website.

"I like how they directly quote the factually website 11 times in the article, but don't directly quote kenneth jeyaretnam's actual post even once."
"LHL: With all 6 pofmas, i can simply snap my fingers and send him to jail. I call that mercy."
"GCB rental is around ~ $150k a month. By paying $20k a month for a bigger and more prime plot of land, it‚Äôs a profit of $130k a month and $1.56M a year while doing absolutely nothing. It‚Äôs a smart move in my opinion"
He got sidebet see how many he can collect lmao
"in footballing terms, that‚Äôs called a double hat-trick"
