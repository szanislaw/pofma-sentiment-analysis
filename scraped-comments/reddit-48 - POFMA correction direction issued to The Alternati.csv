"idk which is more scary, the POFMA... or the fact that building public housing and selling for 800k is still a loss... 

good luck future gen."
Now I have heard of The Alternative View
"&gt;including the total development cost (comprising land cost and construction cost)

I wonder if hdb is only making a loss because of the land cost. If it's buying the land at the same market rate as a private developer then of course it will be making a loss. At the end of the day the land didn't cost the government much money in the first place."
"HDB’s loss is indeed driven by land sales. However, this is NOT a ‘left hand right hand’ situation.

Proceeds from land sales will NOT be available for use by SLA (or Govt) and will instead go into our reserves, and invested. 

We then only spend the returns through the FUTURE Net Investments Returns Contributions - literally as part of the Annual Budget. 

This is to prevent land sales proceeds as a source of our operating income to fund our operating expenditure, which will be affected by the fluctuating property market.

If ^ happens, the government of the time can just sell more land to private developers at higher bids to fund their operating expenditures, which means less incentive for HDB land, which means more expensive public housing."
"You mean they dont?

Its government land with government infrastructure being built over. Where are the losses?"
"&gt; # POFMA correction direction issued to The Alternative View for implying HDB profits from Ang Mo Kio BTO flats

&gt; SINGAPORE: Facebook page The Alternative View has been issued a correction direction for suggesting that the Housing &amp; Development Board (HDB) profits from the sale of Build-to-Order (BTO) flats at Central Weave @ AMK.

&gt; The direction was issued under the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA).

&gt; The case involved a Facebook post three days ago, said the Ministry of National Development (MND) in a news release on Sunday (Sep 3).

&gt; In the post, The Alternative View reproduced the headline of an AsiaOne article stating ""Ang Mo Kio BTO flats: Strong demand for 5-room units despite prices of up to $877k"". The post contained an image of the Minister for National Development Desmond Lee holding a bag of money.

&gt; The post also included a caption: ""How much profit is HDB reaping from this?""

&gt; MND said in its news release: ""Implicitly this post is stating that HDB is making profit from the sale of the Central Weave @ AMK Build-to-Order (BTO) flats, which are part of the August 2022 BTO sales exercise.

&gt; ""This statement is false.""

&gt; The Alternative View will be required to publish a correction notice and provide access to the correct facts.

&gt; HDB will not profit from the sale of the flats, MND said.

&gt; ""In fact, it will incur a loss from this project, as the estimated amount to be collected from the sale is lower than the estimated total development cost of the project.

&gt; ""If we take into account the CPF housing grants that HDB will extend to eligible buyers, the deficit is higher still,"" MND said.

&gt; The HDB incurs a deficit every year, MND said, adding that ""the amount HDB collects from the sale of flats in every financial year is less than the costs it incurs, including the total development cost (comprising land cost and construction cost) and CPF housing grants"".

&gt; For the financial year 2021/2022, HDB incurred a deficit of S$3.85 billion in its Homeownership Programme.

&gt; In the last three years, the average deficit incurred by HDB was about S$2.68 billion per year.

&gt; The deficit is mainly due to ""significant subsidies"" for new flats and the disbursement of CPF housing grants for eligible buyers, MND said.

&gt; ""Because of this, most first-timer buyers use less than a quarter of their monthly income to service their housing loans.

&gt; ""Close to 90 per cent of first-timer families service their HDB loans using CPF with little or no cash payments,"" the ministry said.

&gt; The annual deficit is funded by the Government and is reflected in HDB's audited financial statements published every year, MND added.

"If it is priced at 300k, what will happen?

After the property reach MOP, sold for 1 mil, this 700k gain will find its way back to the market and drive up prices too... In fact its arguable that the current hike in prices in the resale market are driven by this group of buyers, the upgraders. because of that, it then becomes possible to have buyers who can afford DP for new launch like AMO... the 2k psf stuff.

Without bto upgraders, I dont think its possible for so many locals to whack the condo at current prices. So in fact I think HDB rules need to be tweaked if you want to achieve affordability and less speculation.

Ppl like to blame foreigners but foreigners account for like 5-10% of the private property buyers with 20% absd which contributes rightly to the nation coffers."
"If land prices are not factored into the cost, then there will be market distortions from competing uses. Why should the land use not be factored into the cost? If the issue is end user affordability, that should be handled by direct subsidies, not by artificially lowering the cost."
"HDB’s loss driven by the land cost is still a loss.

If we want SLA to sell land to HDB below market price, then we are asking SLA to sell land at a loss. Your land can sell to private developer for $1B, you sell for $800m, you’re making a loss, as simple as that.

And if SLA sells land at a loss to subsidize HDB, who bears this loss? This loss comes in the form of a hole in the national reserves. Which means future generations will be subsidizing present-day HDB owners."
"HDB is not earning any profits?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;comprising land cost and construction cost) and **CPF housing grants**"". 

so thats why the price for BTO keeps getting higher and higher 

its to counteract the housing grant they are giving right"
"Factoring land value in is as if the land does not belong to us liddat. Oh the proceeds goes to investments? I see almost 30% of the temasak portfolio is in China, how is that turning out? 

My honest opinion is that BTO should only be for locals and should not factor in Land cost as the land belongs to the public, not just the government."
"Shouldnt HDB land be treated at zero cost as its part of nation, birth &amp; citizenship building?

How can a mark to market land dev value be put on BTOs just to jack up their prices n make each BTO generation successively smaller &amp; smaller until our birth rate is at record low?

Do they think their plan of making BTOs more expensive &amp; smaller is not causing our record low birth rates?

What is more important, keeping all HDB land values up all the time or increasing HDB flat sizes to encourage multi generation &amp; birth rates?"
"&gt;""How much profit is HDB reaping from this?""  
&gt;  
&gt;MND said in its news release: ""Implicitly this post is stating that HDB is making profit from the sale

Hmm, surely the mere act of asking a question does not qualify as falsehood? It's not the same as declaring definitively that ""HDB **is** making a profit from the flats"".

How much money is the govt stealing from us via CPF? How much money Ho Ching is siphoning from Temasek? How many political opponents did Lee Kuan Yew unjustly jail?  Just because I'm asking a question about a subject matter does not mean I assert the subject matter itself is factual and true. The answer could be zero to all."
Buy hdb flat. Move in. Take a deep breath. That cost 800k.
"it is a mistake to think of government and public housing as money-making operations.

anyway, it was the government that decided that they wanted to re-develop these blocks despite a healthy number of years left on their lease. So they will take the hit."
At 800K still have losses. Means break even is what? 1 mil? 1 mil public housing everyone
"Dishonest siol. Factoring in land price, this is not condo wor where private have to bid land from garment lor. Ownself buy from ownself, slap ownself with intrinsic values and say lose money. Jin power lar. BTO need wait 5 years and still need to deal with this kind of dishonesty."
"Honestly, it's very hard to believe there are no profits when the price of a flat is so much and the labour is cheap. A block of flats doesn't occupy much land too. lease is only 99 years.

Somebody or some entity is obviously making profit, we don't know who."
"In this thread: Analysis of to what extent the government can actually sell land to one of its branches and what does it mean.

POFMA: Fuck you, God said you're wrong.

Just seems like the law isn't actually meant to promote meaningful understanding of politics, guys."
