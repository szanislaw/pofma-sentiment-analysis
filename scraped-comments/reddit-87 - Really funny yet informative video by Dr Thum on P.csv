"He makes a lot of valid points but his bias is overwhelming and a little unbecoming for an academic.

He seems to primarily talk with like-minded people and seldom gets challenged on his views on his talks/videos.

The one time he got into a public debate, he got rekt by K Shanmugam.

Also he thinks he is Jon Stewart or something but just isn't that funny.

He says this in the video:

""The law effectively makes all criticism of the PAP government illegal.""

Any reasonable person will know this is not a correct analysis, he should stick to history."
"In fact, the whole series by Dr. Thum is top-notch. He explains all these issues often shied away from or often even denied by the government. Although he is a critic, he does so in a very logical and measured way, convincing you of the inherent flaws in our system. Do give it a watch to learn more about these issues this GE!!!

Posting this video in particular as I find this POFMA issue especially Draconian and Orwellian, and how we were powerless to stop it from happening in our modern 21st-century society.

Just a few weeks after he posted this video, he got POFMA'd. Talk about **irony** right??? But the government's actions actually affirmed his conclusions, and he made another episode to talk about it 2 weeks ago.

I find it really really disheartening that coherent and legitimate critics such as Dr. Thum are given so little limelight (his videos recently have less than 100k views), while the highly censored mainstream media remains the core avenue for Singaporeans' news and viewpoints :( Please share this with any many friends and family as you can!!!!"
Watching it now. Thanks for the share! I've always wondered what exactly POFMA was about.
