"I'm strongly against making false statements to drive an agenda, and I do think that some of the POFMA issued against some of our opposition figures were well deserved.

However, my ick with this particular POFMA is that the POFMA were not issued with regards to explicit untruths that were stated by the Jom article, but with regards to what the ministers and the judge *thinks* the reader will conclude upon reading the article. When used this way, you're no longer using POFMA to fight against misinformation, but you're trying to use it to control how people think.

&gt; However, the judge said in her view, an objective and reasonable segment of the audience would read the article as a whole and not merely the three “facts”. “The flow of the text within the article and its conclusion is an assertion that conflicts of interest caused SLA to spend more than $1m in taxpayer money to renovate the large properties despite the low rental return,” she added.

No. The article didn't make the assertion explicitly at all. It may be phrased in a biased way, but whatever conclusion the reader wants to draw is up to the reader themselves, not up to the judge to think ""in her view"" what the readers will conclude

&gt; The Inquiry had submitted in its appeal that the title was an open question. But the Attorney-General said the query was a rhetorical question that the article then answers in the affirmative

A rhetorical question is still a rhetorical question, it is not an assertion.

Is the Earth truly round? I'm not saying yes, but I'm not saying no either.

(Edit: on further thought, the POFMA may be even worst than the Jom article with respect to spreading misinformation. The POFMA is explicitly asserting that the Jom article made certain untrue statements that it did not actually made, while the Jom article was, at worse, suggestive)"
"&gt;Justice Thean said the subject material could have multiple meanings, one of which, as The Inquiry submits, “is to take ‘at face value’ the three bare facts that would shock the reader”. “Presumably, this reaction would be linked to the author’s opinion that the ministers lived very privileged lives,” said Justice Thean. However, the judge said in her view, an objective and reasonable segment of the audience would read the article as a whole and not merely the three “facts”.

Living privilege lives is an opinion, a state of mind, subjective nuance and hearsay? 

Mental gymnastics, propaganda, gaslighting or power of thought, humbling narratives?

I’m loss of words but thank you for clarifying."
"if you wanted to undermine confidence in the judiciary, this is the way to do it. it never ceases to amaze me how they can just create their own conclusions out of thin air.

&gt;“The flow of the text within the article and its conclusion is an assertion that conflicts of interest caused SLA to spend more than $1m in taxpayer money to renovate the large properties despite the low rental return,” she added."
Our leaders understand that pofmaing something will simply drive traffic towards it right? Right?
"It is very well written and certainly of much public importance. To me 2 of the 3 comments that were targeted should should not have been there - $1M renovation and the “the bare facts’.

Anyway the article taken as a whole without the 2 comments is accurate and highly damaging it. No sensationalism, good arguments and well reasoned.

POFMA in this case is just a side show as the author has made his case."
"&gt;Justice Thean joined the Singapore Legal Service in 1992. After her first posting as a Justices’ Law Clerk, she held various appointments within the public service, including Assistant Registrar at the Supreme Court, Senior State Counsel at the Attorney General’s Chambers, **Deputy Secretary of the Ministry of Law** and Senior District Judge of the Family and Juvenile Justice Division of the State Courts. She taught arbitration as an Adjunct Associate Professor at the National University of Singapore Law Faculty.

I heard that job is just a glorified property agent"
"Getting POFMA-ed, the ultimate blue-tick."
Why bother having a channel for appeals when the entire court and media system is in bed with these ridout clowns?
"The year of 2023 should have the ""Streisand Effect"" tagged onto it"
Isn't it ironic the executive decides the use of the tools of the legislative and judiciary? It's almost as if the executive controls the legislative and judiciary branches
"""It was an assertion of fact made by the author in order to support his opinion that because of the issue of conflicts of interest, many questions remained unanswered after the review that SM Teo (ought not to have) helmed,” said Justice Thean.

Wow.. the cushioning effect of those words in the bracket change the meaning entirely."
POFMA seems very handy for controlling the narrative rather than to stomp out real fake news.
2025 you need to come faster.
Fuck POFMA.
Honest question wet POFMA: if one states upfront that they are expressing an opinion is the author clear of POFMA?  Eg if the author states the facts about Ridout and then says “in my opinion these facts lead to a conclusion that…”
