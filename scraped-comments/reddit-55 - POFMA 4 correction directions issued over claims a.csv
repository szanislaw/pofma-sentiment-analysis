"The correction directions will be issued to:

 HardwareZone user “darksiedluv”, 

The Temasek Review’s Facebook page, and 

The Online Citizen’s Facebook page and website.

 It will also be issued to Singaporean lawyer Mr Lim Tean for “sharing the falsehood on his Facebook page”."
"I figured out how to find her salary. 

Post on facebook 1 billion times with every dollar value from $1 to $1 billion. The facebook post that never kenna pofma will be her true salary."
"Now we see what POFMA really is for.

Continue giving them a strong mandate and next they'll be setting up a ministry of love."
"?? MOF use POFMA for temasek, does this mean POFMA can extend to temasek linked companies as well?? where does it stop?"

Lai liao... why did they think they'd be safe with a userid when their mobile numbers are used for registration...
Here's the fucking abuse of POFMA.

"Can any lawyers tell me how is this legal?

Based on their official website, POFMA can only be used if:

&amp;#x200B;

* Be prejudicial to Singapore’s security;
* Be prejudicial to public health, public safety, public tranquillity or public finances;
* Be prejudicial to the friendly relations of Singapore with other countries;
* Influence the outcome of a [presidential election](https://singaporelegaladvice.com/law-articles/presidential-election/), [general election](https://singaporelegaladvice.com/law-articles/general-election/), by-election or referendum;
* Incite feelings of enmity, hatred or ill-will between different groups of persons; or
* Diminish public confidence in the government.

And since Temasek is a private company, how's this legal?"
"Now private companies can pofma if they don't like the things people are saying about them? What next random people can also pofma? 

""Hubby, people on the internet are calling me a HO, can issue pofma to say I'm not a sex worker?"""
Is Lim Tean so influential? I have a feeling he'll just wear this as a badge of honor
"I guess they will define TH as a critical part of ""Singapore's public finances"" - though its finance is never really public.

I am not sure how claims of HC's salary impacts Singapore public's finances. Probably they are going to frame it as HC being ""overpaid"" or something along the line which is untrue?"
"So, how do we know they are wrong if they don't say her Salary ?"
Srsly? They use government law for this? Wow.
"Can hardly think of why this is important to them as of this moment, or ever."
Still waiting for POFMA to be used with equal enthusiasm on things that don't involve our elite leaders.
"&gt; # POFMA: 4 correction directions issued over claims about Ho Ching’s Temasek Holdings salary

&gt; SINGAPORE: The Minister of Finance has instructed that four correction directions be issued over claims that Temasek Holdings’ chief executive Ms Ho Ching's annual salary is ""around S$100 million"".

&gt; “Several online posts carried a false statement regarding the remuneration of Temasek Holdings Pte Ltd's Executive Director &amp; Chief Executive Officer, Ms Ho Ching,” the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) office said in a news release on Sunday (Apr 19).

&gt; The correction directions will be issued to HardwareZone user “darksiedluv”, The Temasek Review’s Facebook page, and The Online Citizen’s Facebook page and website. It will also be issued to Singaporean lawyer Mr Lim Tean for “sharing the falsehood on his Facebook page”.

&gt; “The authors made various claims that the annual salary of Temasek CEO Ms Ho Ching is ‘NT$ 2.1 billion’, ‘about 100 million SGD’ or ‘S$99 million a year’,” the Government added on its Factually article. It said all these claims are false.

&gt; Temasek Holdings said earlier on Sunday such claims were false and came from ""chatter based on an Asian talk show commentary"".

&gt; Mdm Ho is the wife of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.

"Congratulations to the Scums of Singapore who voted for such an authoritarian, non-transparent government.

Well done retards! :)"
recommend this thread be deleted
"MOF made it clear that gossip over SG reserves is off-limits, they've already POFMAed people for speculating about Temasek before this. I guess speculating about Ho Ching's salary falls under that."
