"&gt;The Ministry of National Development (MND) said Mr Yee had published posts on his Facebook page last month that falsely claimed that actions taken by the ministry against the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council (AHTC) were ""politically motivated"", among other assertions.


Who do you believe? The government who insist that they are whiter than white, or your own lying eyes? Saying ""politically motivated"" is *objectively, backed by state power* false basically means you're not even allowed to speculate about the motivations behind the PAP government's actions.


Actually about 2 steps from 1984."
"Reminds me of this quote:

“Singling out political opponents for working against the ruling party is precisely the tactic of every tyrannical government from Red China to Venezuela. The first step in the process is creating unfounded public suspicion of political opponents, followed by arresting and jailing any who continue speaking against the regime.”"
"Laws for thee, but not for me! Hehe"
"Political tool being used as intended. 

Just saying...."
"&gt;falsely claimed that actions taken by the ministry against the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council (AHTC) were ""politically motivated"", among other assertions.

Ideally you want to highlight and start with the most obvious false claim. Unless the other assertions were even more believable...

&gt;Mr Yee also said MND's decision to withhold grants from AHTC, to call in external auditors and to call for an independent panel (IP) were ""politically motivated and not based on legitimate concerns"", the ministry said.

This would have been lot more believable before SPH was found to be faking readers numbers and the response from authorities was to shrug and repeat that SPH will still get 900m of taxpayers money.

&gt;""Mr Yee's post was misleading because it omitted important context that AHTC's own auditors had highlighted serious lapses by AHTC, which then triggered the subsequent audits. MND therefore had legitimate and sufficient basis to call in the external auditors,"" said the ministry.

This itself is missing context of why AHTC was only TC with problems. Aljunied residents seem to disagree that MND was not AIMing to sabotage AHTC given the election results. Even the courts found no fraud or money missing...."
"As mentioned, y'all supported for this to happen. You shouldn't complain, they are doing what the majority supported them to do.

If you are not happy, you better make it known.

Else, get back to work. Stop taking MC or complaining about WLB. You are making Singapore uncompetitive  /s"
"POFMA is the new cry wolf.

When real shit happens that might actually justify POFMA (eg recent riots in the UK because someone claimed a black teenager who stabbed kids crossed over illegally, when in fact he was born there)...

People may just ignore it."
PAP + POFMA = invincible against any party and some say even invincible against God
"Oh yeah, we believe POFMA over YJJ, lolz."
"This is like scoring an own goal as it irks the public and works against the incumbent.

The thinking public saw what happened, but the fools wouldn't."
"how to prove something is politically motivated? politicians will always have some pretext whether it's benghazi or russian interference. no sane politician would say "" yeah my investigation is a partisan witch hunt"". who thinks it is a good idea to let politicians enforce their motivation as an objective fact???"
Is he the first wp member to get pofma?
"Maybe certain things fell in place on their own, but it's hard to say that other things weren't politically motivated since the WP MPs succeeded in most of their appeals in court."
POFMA is useless. No one bothers with it these days. People will still continue to believe what they want to believe
There goes the WP's clean record of having no members with POFMA orders served against them. Why do they like to shoot from the hips so much?
