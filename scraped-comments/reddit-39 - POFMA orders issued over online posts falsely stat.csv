"We need another COP to look into TCJ conflict of interest, which undermine his ability to be impartial as he has an undisclosed affair with a MP. And then grill pinky for hours and hours loh.

"What Andrew Loh posted:

&gt;If Pritam Singh's alleged non-disclosure of his knowledge of Raeesah Khan's lies warranted a Committee of Privileges hearing (as indeed a COP was convened to look onto it), then shouldn't there also be a COP to look into Lee Hsien Loong's non-disclosure of his knowledge of Tan Chuan-jin's affair and letting him continue to be Speaker of Parliament, presiding over the highest law-making body in Singapore? Pritam was accused of not divulging his knowledge for a few months. And who was the chairman of that COP in 2022? Yup, it was Tan Chuan-jin. 

It could probably be construed that Andrew had wrongly stated the cause for the COP to be triggered. But if one reads on, one realises Andrew’s point here was also that TCJ was appointed to chair the COP despite his known state of affairs (pun fully intended). Even if Andrew had left the first half of this para out, the question remains: why is someone who is compromised in terms of moral (and arguably executive) authority given full rein of this committee? That POFMA chose to pick on the cause for the COP, which is inconsequential to questions regarding TCJ’s appointment to said COP, surely shows that they could do better to correct their myopia."
"Good lol. Talk shit, get POFMA'd."
