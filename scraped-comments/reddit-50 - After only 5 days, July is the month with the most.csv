"A link to my POFMA explainer infographic: https://pofmaed.com/explainer-what-is-pofma/ (which answers questions like who can use POFMA, what medium is most POFMAed, and what the grounds for appeal are. Some numbers are unfortunately outdated because the 5 latest POFMA uses were issued a few hours after I published)"
"PAP is very triggered and annoyed that WP asked voters not to give blank cheque.  In their press statement against Ms Khan:

""WP should not ask voters to write it a blank cheques in Sengkang or any where else it contests"".

They are in no right to dictate what WP is to say or not to say by WP.   Farting a damn bloody bully. 

Let us all NOT TO GIVE THEM BLANK CHEQUE."
