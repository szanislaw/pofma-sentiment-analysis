"Well if POFMA corrects false rumors with proper facts, there is nothing wrong with it. The only problem is if it muddles facts, which I believe hasn't happened yet. People have to be responsible for what they publish, be it journalist or regular folks.

The fact that a rando can spread the rumor so far and wide as to reach Shanmugam proves that social media is a very powerful tool, and can have very far reaching consequences even though a regular citizen posted it.

The govt can not allow SPF's reputation to be smeared like this, they need it to be faultless to keep the trust between citizens and SPF. I'm surprised there isn't harsher action taken."
"One thing you will find changing is the language used to post things online. It would be important to prefix your posts with ""In my opinion"" and ""In my view"". 

In my opinion it is not possible to POFMA an opinion. As by definition an opinion is not a statement or deceleration of facts. 

For example, in my opinion the world is flat. 

That statement is scientifically false, but it never claims to be a fact, but merely an opinion that - I believe - one is still entitled to express."
"Why shouldn't people keep receipt of evidences of their experience? Its a good practice to do so and can help to back up the validity of their claims. Otherwise it would become he say, she say and add to misinformation and confusion.

In my opinion, there should still be some accountability and standard to citizen 'journalists', we can't just let then off the hook just because they are questioning the government and aren't considered professional journalists. They should provide some receipts and evidences before publishing their claims."

"&gt;  I did not agree with the way that TOC left room for the work of police officers here to be questioned and doubted baselessly, but that doesn't mean that their journalistic methods are wicked, or that they had some ulterior motive in pursuing this case. 

Uhh... really?

Also ""left room for the work of police officers to be questioned"" is a very mild and roundabout way of putting things"
"If POFMA can be applied to anyone, even ordinary citizen,, then its one sided since only ministers can issue an order. 
To give parity, ordinary citizens should be given power to issue POFMA as well? By providing the evidence as well of course. 
Clearly, POFMA is simply too lopsided.  To put it blatantly, POFMA implies that only ministers/govt tell the truth, everyone else cannot be trusted."
"No, it is used in a proper manner."
"&gt; but that doesn't mean that their journalistic methods are wicked, or that they had some ulterior motive in pursuing this case. 

their motive is pretty obvious though. you seen the rest of the site?

&gt;  POFMA was used against an ordinary citizen and not just a media organisation or news site, by making him issue a correction to his original instagram story. I think this should make us wary of the precedent it sets of the state surveilling the content created by ordinary citizens on their personal accounts

i struggle to understand your point here. you acknowledge he does not lose his opinion. doesn't that mean he is free to keep it and develop it further?

&gt; I believe that such POFMA action would have a chilling effect on citizen journalism, especially when citizens have to be start keeping receipts or evidence for their experiences before even thinking of sharing it on a social media platform through their private/public accounts. Even then, the validity of such ""Ã«vidence"" can be challenged or dismissed by the state as untruths, leaving most ordinary citizens unable to establish the credibility of their stories.

this is the key point right? there is a power imbalance between state and individual. i think a better way of looking at this is asymmetric warfare. on the govt's side, folks just dont fact check enough these days and the initial readers of the article in point may have just concluded the police force is being thuggish towards elderly in these trying times

on the individual, it is pretty much close to an online lynch if you posted something completely off... which brings us to the flip side:

you have the recent jade vs MOM case. frankly, dont see how any reader of the saga walked away feeling more confident in MOM's covid-handling competency (both in communications and handling domestic workers). in the hypothetical scenario MOM did issue pofma it would have massively backfired, she literally brought the receipts and was as factual as you can get"
"&gt;Secondly, looking more broadly at the powers of POFMA in this particular  
 case, I feel that it has been used excessively to castigate TOC as an   
irresponsible, malicious and repugnant actor, not explicitly through the  
 POFMA order, but very clearly through the statements by SPF and   
Shanmugam especially.

Eh the thing is they are irresponsible and malicious when it comes to the PAP. Blame Terry Xu for that.

&gt;You can see this rather clearly in the comments section of TOC's FB posts  
 on the matter, when people immediately faulted them for taking   
advantage of the elderly woman's dementia condition to spin their   
narrative, echoing what Shanmugam had said in his press conference. You   
actually also did see some positive comments asking for TOC to state   
clearly what their motive was, instead of jumping to such conclusions,   
which TOC actually did. They said that they did not know she had   
dementia and hence had no way of spinning it in a way to suit any agenda

Those comments only came in when SPF first responded, however TOC doubled down. What you see on their FB is a more sanitized version of their double down"
"You are going to be downvoted heavily for your opinion, but I absolutely agree with you. There is too much inherent power differences between the individual and the state, and POFMA only exists to add another layer to that.

People need to stop conflating issues and look at the bigger picture. It has become the norm in recent years for government ministries and agencies to respond and reply to any trending stories or personal accounts by any individual. Sometimes, they are even backed up by relevant ministers. Unless an individual keeps receipts like Jade Rasif did, the chances of anyone emerging as the victor of truth is very low, owing to state propaganda through newspapers or the general trust and belief in our government systems. I can only imagine how hard it would be to tell their own individual story, especially for people who are not as resourceful.

POFMA is overkill to these group of people. I fail to see why there is a need to slap POFMA on top of a video and text clarification from the SPF, which should be convincing enough for the truth as judging from popular opinion. I understand if TOC is given POFMA since it is a news site, but for the individual? If the norm is now that everyday citizens will be slapped with POFMA for presenting their individual accounts of everyday lives, then who would want to speak out against something they see that might be wrong?

Because in doing so, we have sent a message to all Singaporeans, that being safe is better than being sorry, and if you ever see any instance of injustice, better to not do anything, than to do something and be wrong, even if you came from a place of good intentions."
We should go back to the time before POFMA where the govt can also order a takedown but you don't have any avenue for recourse. Really makes you wonder if people who complain about POFMA are like 10 years old because they are so young they can't remember the Govt have took down sites and news article before POFMA existed.
"&gt; not explicitly through the POFMA order, but very clearly through the statements by SPF and Shanmugam especially. 

That's no fault of POFMA. 

&gt; I think this again sets a dangerous precedent for the the government acting as an unchecked and monopolistic arbiter of the truth in Singapore.

POFMA just continues the precedent...

&gt; But that you should even have the ability and information to decide for yourself. 

If you consider the voters stupid and shortsighted POFMA makes a lot of sense. 

&gt; echoing what Shanmugam had said in his press conference. 

You saw the same thing in Parti Liyani's case where Shanmugam made a lot of snide remarks and implied she was guilty of a few things in parliament. Then you saw many fb comments repeating the same thing as the maid might be freed but was not innocent. 

&gt; If the government truly wants to maintain trust in its institutions, the way to do so is not to silence journalists or contradictory voices

It worked well so far. From the time before printing press... to today. Why change when things still work relatively well. SPH going non profit and getting more under the thumb of pap does not look like a freer media landscape is otw.

Look at how the the space for online expression has shrunk since 2011 or new laws put in place (not just POFMA but Presidential election). 

Imagine the crapfest that awaits us when there is an actual danger of pap losing power."
"That's why people are so against this ridiculous law in the first place, it's used to suppress dissent. And ironically the gov themselves can't be pofmad."
"Only criminals will be afraid of the Law.

And if the Law should one day be twisted, no amount of it will be able to stop the people.

It's simple."
