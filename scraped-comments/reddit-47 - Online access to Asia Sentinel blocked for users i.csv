"&gt;MHA added: “If Asia Sentinel truly believes in free speech, it should be happy for its readers to read both the article and the correction notice, and make up their own minds which is true.”

okay, so will MCI reciprocate and publish Asia Sentinel's reply to the POFMA notice at the top of their factually website as well? so that readers can make up their own minds right :)

anyway, here is Asia Sentinel's reply:

&gt;The Singapore government alleges we were incorrect in pointing out that Singapore Government officials threatened to end Nikkei Inc.’s business operations in Singapore... The threat was made by an unnamed official at the Embassy of the Government of Singapore... Asia Sentinel verified the threat from two sources who prefer to remain nameless out of fear of retaliation, and is satisfied with its veracity.  
&gt;  
&gt;The government says that because Nikkei printed a letter to the editor from the Singapore government over the issue, that constitutes a Nikkei retraction. That is not true. That merely demonstrates that Nikkei was willing to grant a courtesy to the Singapore government, which traditionally has demanded a right to be heard.  
&gt;  
&gt;Our story reported that M Ravi was suspended from practicing law for five years because he had criticized the government... The court suspended M Ravi’s license for five years in response to statements he made outside a courthouse and posts he shared on Facebook... M Ravi criticized the Public Prosecutor and the government for their “overzealous” prosecution of Gobi and called for an apology to his client.   
&gt;  
&gt;The government disputes our reporting that Lee Hsien Yang, the Prime Minister's brother, and his wife Lee Suet Fern were forced to leave Singapore because government action was threatened against them for their family dispute with the prime minister. Lee Hsien Yang has repeatedly said he left Singapore because he and his wife feared for their safety... It is difficult to think of any other reason the two were forced to leave Singapore out of fear unless it was the use of the government's power against them in what amounted to a family dispute."
"Allow people to read both, but their version must be on top..."
"Ha, I mentioned this would happen and got downvoted.

Its the only thing shan can do."

"Govt: Do not touch this bad thing! 

Me: Ah yes, nice to see the Barbra Streisand effect at play here."
I have Google DNS set at the router level. Seems to work really well to workaround all these “blockages”
I thought we are against cancel culture.
This why there's no independent media in Singapore. Try to publish news from another viewpoint = blocked. All you need is state own media.
"A person who claim that he got nothing to hide, now is hiding the news  from me….."
"Who is the PAPG to deny my right to read many of the good articles that I have come across in AS?

Fortunately for VPN technology.

That is why an electoral system that makes any party dominant is not a good electoral system."
"When will the PAP realize that these types of tactics will no longer work?  Seriously outdated, out of touch, and ignorant.  

You can't just block content.  You have to actually create well-formed arguments to support your position, and let the readers make up their own conclusions.  

Viva la VPN!"

"People are commenting the DNS bypass and VPN, but also, if you’re more serious about it I’d recommend Tor. The network needs more users to sustain k-anonymity."
I have never heard of Asia Sentinel before today. I have now and just subscribed.
"Great firewall of Singapore?  
Sounds like communism."
"What was the particularly offending article, asking for research purposes."
CNA and Straits Times publishing it. It can happen to them.
A circus.
*laughs in VPN*

"Is this andy wong guy in control of the group or at least a prolific uploader? There can only be one truth leh, the courts acted after having proof right? Why the heck after his sentencing, he's here saying it's entirely a mistake, but his defense didn't do anything about it?"
That’s why I only read local news sources. Guarantee to be accurate and factual.
"A block may seem kinda like an overreach, but was Asia Sentinel's allegations actually substantiated?"
Erm....is vpn still a thing?just asking for a friend...
