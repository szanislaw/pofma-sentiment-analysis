"regardless of your opinion on capital punishment, i implore people to judge kirsten's reporting objectively. she has no regard for facts for a supposed ""journalist"". her reporting is always emotional-bait and agenda-driven. she deliberately obfuscates certain information that won't support her biased angle of reporting.

tbh this pofma order is long overdue for someone like her."
"kind of ridiculous that this article lumps five different people/groups together and then just says ""false statements"". who said what? did they all say the same thing?"

"Even though I am against fake news, I feel that the POFMA law gives the government too much power to cover up anything potentially scandalous that may erode the public 's trust in them. 

I remember Jade Rasif was disputed by the Ministry of Manpower in 2021 saying her claims were ""inaccurate"" concerning her helper being tested positive for Covid and Jade herself not given a quarantine order but she had to appear in court for a separate case and thus was investigated by the police for ""violating a quarantine order"" that she was not given. It wasnâ€™t until she provided her recordings of conversations with the Ministry of Manpower that the government apologised and retracted points from their original statement.
