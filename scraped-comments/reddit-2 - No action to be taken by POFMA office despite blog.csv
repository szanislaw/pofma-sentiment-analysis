"&gt;	In an email response to Ang, the POFMA office claimed that the relevant ministry or ministries are “in the best position” to assess whether a statement is false and determine if it is in the public interest to take action.

they found a new way to say “ownself check ownself” lol"
POFMA is one of those law that the government uses on its people but not the other way around
"The response from the POFMA office is, in essence, ""I'm gonna taichi you to other ministries, and cc the Prime Minister's Office""."
"Biggest omission: in 1980 majority of families only needed single Income to hit the median level. Mother gets to stay home to raise the kids. 

Today it's largely dual income in order to barely achieve median household income. 

Tldr: Singaporeans have to work twice as hard today to achieve the same house hold income in the 1980s."
"lmao I guess false information is fine if it benefits the right people

and don't forget well funded state media blindly repeating ministerial speeches while it falls to some random blogger to do the real journalistic work (AGAIN)"
The chosen stats presented was also cherry picked. For example median household income in 1980 was from single income which was very common. The median household income now is from dual income.
Well we know what pofma is for. Anyone couldve told you this the day it was passed. Why the hell would they pofma themselves.
Wow if this is for real…its not fair at all…they need to at least get the person to acknowledge it and ensure that will work on accuracy
Another reason to not vote for the incumbent in 2025. Voting for the first time and will not make any mistake in my decision.
"POFMA defines a 'false statement of fact' as a false or misleading statement which a reasonable person would consider to be a representation of fact.

Minister ought to read his fucking rulebook that him and his chumps passed into law from time to time."
"This was LW’s May Day Speech, not him talking at some CC event. 

Strange that LW (a PM-in-waiting) can just read out the entire speech without double-checking the numbers beforehand, or notice the jarring fact that the BTO scheme did not exist in 1980?

How is this guy PM calibre if he can’t tell that the figures seemed off? He has lived through that era, and it’s a well known fact that BTO is only a recent thing. How does he not know?"
"""I will POFMA you for requesting to POFMA me""

Well it's obvious our pap ministers have POFMA immunity."
Rules for thee but not for me.
ownself cannot pofma ownself
"Median household income what a joke statistic to use in the first place 

1980s only single income family most of the time

2022? Dual income sometimes event 3-4 person working in the same household to get that 9k 

Yeah totally the same"
LW first May day speech as the PM-in-waiting will be remembered as spreading falsehood. What a great start!
sooo surprising
"This is so laughable, having stepped on the very bear trap they set for the rest of Singapore."
Rules for thee but not for me
Rules for thee but not for me
"I guess the ""whole rules for thee and not for me"" applies; but to be fair, if you go with the objectives of the POFMA, the errors are down to merely poor checked of facts, rather than a deliberate effort to mislead the public"
"Please at least read the items that the blogger, Phillip Ang is flagging out to POFMA office and not just the catchy title. 

Taken from this, the sourced site of the article: [https://likedatosocanmeh.wordpress.com/2023/05/24/case-id-cas-855823-j9s3q4-falsehoods-on-pmo-website-online-media/](https://likedatosocanmeh.wordpress.com/2023/05/24/case-id-cas-855823-j9s3q4-falsehoods-on-pmo-website-online-media/)

**Quotation from LW Speech**

DPM Wong: ""In 1980, the price of a 4R BTO flat (1) in a new town at that time indeed was around $40,000 (2). But back then, the median household income was around $900 (3)… But the median household income has risen ten times too, from $900 to $9,000 today. (4)""

**Falsehood No. 1 claimed**

- In 1980, the BTO scheme did not even exist; it was launched 21 years later in 2001, fully implemented in 2002. HDB introduces the Build-to-order system – Singapore History (nlb.gov.sg)

Fair enough on a technicality level

**Falsehood No. 2 claimed**

- The price of a 4R flat (RFS, non BTO) in a new town in 1980 was not $40,000. According to an online media article, a 4R flat was priced at $27,100. Price of 4-room HDB flats in new town sold at $27,000 and not $40,000 in 1980 – The Online Citizen Asia

- The TOC article referenced an archived New Nation article (1979). Newspaper Article – Your guide to buying a flat – or, New Nation, 7 June 1979, Page 10/11 (nlb.gov.sg)

- As can be seen in the New Nation image below, the price of a 4R flat in a new town was indeed $27,100.

Didnt look too much into the details of this but at least there is a source backing the discrepancy. 

**Falsehood No. 3 claimed**

- In a 2015 speech, then-DPM Tharman said: ""But, remember, the median household income was just $990 in 1980 (compared to $7,320 last year)."" sequential (mof.gov.sg) (see page 11)

- DPM Wong should have known that $990 is not ""around $900"".

This is just nit picking isnt it?

**Falsehood No. 4 claimed**

- According to a recent CNA article, the median household income in 2022 was $10,099, not ""$9000 today"". Median household income in Singapore rose slightly in 2022 to S$10,099 – CNA (channelnewsasia.com)

Surprise surprise, an error that, if corrected at face value, actually further supports the establishment's narrative (regardless of how the numbers can be gamed)

Well the reply from POFMA office is nothing much to be expected of, the standard we will look into it because the one responding to the email definitely isnt the one making the decision on whether to POFMA, neither would they announce a decision to POFMA through email to a random individual. 

And yes its stupid that anything that is POFMA-ed is instantly made to seem like an intentional lie rather than an error, mis-interpretation or different perspective."
"&gt;As of 31 December 2022, POFMA office issued 77 correction directions orders to a total of 42 cases.     
&gt;     
&gt;The POFMA legislation grants all government ministers the authority to issue various orders, such as instructing online news sites to publish corrections to falsehoods.     
&gt;     
&gt;Considering how ministers manage their diverse portfolios in exercising POFMA powers, it would seem that only the ministers themselves can issue a POFMA correction direction, as was the case with Mr Wong – also referred to as “***ownself check ownself***”."
POFMA for thee not for me
"Major news outlet typically do a fact-check, like NYT during Donald Trump’s State of the Union address (busy day at the office, i presume). 

What is Straits Times’ take on this?"
So fucking glad we aren't letting that liar get away with it.
"4 legs good 2 legs better, pofma"
Probably because said blogger was a goddamn moron.
send to teo chee hean to review the speech thanks
"Sounds like POFMA are for the peasants, not for the elites."

Here are some guidelines for best practices:

&gt; You should **submit from a variety of sources** (a general rule of thumb is that **10% or less of your posting and conversation should link to your own content**), talk to people in the comments (and not just on your own links), and **generally be a good member of the community**.

https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439

&gt; Feel free to post links to your own content (within reason). But if **that's all you ever post**, or it always seems to get voted down, take a good hard look in the mirror — **you just might be a spammer**. A widely used rule of thumb is the 9:1 ratio, i.e. **only 1 out of every 10 of your submissions should be your own content**.

Edit: guess astroturfing is well accepted as long as it’s astroturfing for the favored side huh."
"TOC? What’s new, moving on."
"I think the more pertinent question is, did Wong deliberately lie or was he just negligent/careless?"
One set of law for the rich and powerful and another set for the commoners.
