"Literally the one use of POFMA that it is designed for‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI dunno‚Ä¶ maybe‚Ä¶ is it too much‚Ä¶?‚Äù

ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è what is wrong with this bunch of ü§°?"
"If MOH is so certain that Ivermectin does not treat COVID-19, then why did they not use POFMA immediately when the falsehood was spreading? 

When the ‚ÄúAhma takes Ivermectin and ends up in ICU‚Äù news came out in 5 Oct, they should have already started probing the origin of such dangerous falsehood, and they should have already hauled these people to court. 

The government can wield POFMA around so quickly at opposition critics, and yet now they need to take weeks to even consider using the law on something that they already know for a 100% that is false? Is it because they are afraid of offending the hardcore religious demographics which are likely to be conservatives? Give me a break la."
"Can we POFMA him for saying life would be much more normal once we reach 80% vax?

Fucking ü§°"
Should really Pofma everything the MMTF say. That‚Äôs the real fake news.
"IIRC OYK wielded the mighty POFMA on his first day as Minister of Health (as a show of power I assume).

I‚Äôm seriously wondering what took him so long to deliberate on the action to POFMA this kind of fake news - stuff that POFMA is meant for"
HELLO IRIS KOH
"Why may be used? Unless there‚Äôs actually some shred of truth in what these anti vaxxers are saying (which there basically isn‚Äôt), why not just POFMA? Really defeats the purpose of having it in the first place if it‚Äôs just used as a political weapon."
Does covid-19 falsehoods involve concrete roadmaps?
"you are the falsehood 

suka suka change here change there knn"
"One of the persons spreading falsehoods seems to be this OYK.

One time he said got 1000 ICU beds for covid patients, now he saying 2/3rds of ICU beds occupied (71 beds occupied now only) and hospitals under pressure. What a buffoon!

"May? **May?**

If there was ever a use for POFMA, it should be for shit like this. And it should have been exercised ages ago, when all this anti-mask and anti-vax nonsense started gaining traction. 

And they're only **NOW** thinking about using it?

üëè

Really speaks volumes about what the original intent of POFMA was, eh? Not like we didn't know it then..."
Wow what an improvement by the government. Only one year too late this time.
oh no i think OYK is useless. am i going to be pofma now?
"Use la   What you waiting for? Still throw not enough Ong family face meh?

PM candidate still so wishy washy. My RSM‚Äôs grandmother is ashamed that you call yourself a singaporean."
Can use pofma against u or not u incompetent shit?!
Saying we will move into an endemic mindset is a falsehood too?
use lah cb. why may
someone seems to back on his media loving ways after a few weeks of quiet üôÑ
"No need think, just do it"
"&gt; # Pofma may be used against those who spread Covid-19 falsehoods: Ong Ye Kung

&gt; SINGAPORE - The Ministry of Health (MOH) is looking into using the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (Pofma) on those who spread falsehoods about Covid-19 treatment.

&gt; This includes those who say that anti-parasitic drug ivermectin is a safe and effective treatment for the disease, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said on Wednesday (Oct 20).

&gt; ""We are certainly looking into it,"" Mr Ong said. ""And just to be clear, in MOH, the medical professionals are very clear that ivermectin is not suitable for the treatment of Covid.""

&gt; The dosages of ivermectin used in laboratory settings to kill the virus are too high for humans to safely use, he added.

&gt; The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority stopped the illegal import of 23,100 ivermectin tablets between Sept 10 and Oct 6.

&gt; Ivermectin came under scrutiny earlier this month, when a 65-year-old retiree fell violently ill and was hospitalised after taking it.

&gt; MOH said in a Facebook post on Oct 15 that ivermectin is a prescription-only medicine registered only for the treatment of parasitic worm infections.

&gt; It is not an anti-viral medication and is not approved by the Health Sciences Authority for the prevention or treatment of Covid-19.

"**Neki: ""JUST DO IT. Chor nia. Whack only.""**  

If it helps, just imagine those spreading false covid information as WhammyJoTheSmiley; may help with the urge to put an immediate reaction to the shenanigans of those false info spreaders."

Wtf do you mean by ‚Äúmay‚Äù? What else is POFMA for?
OYK go POFMA yourself la knn
dont pofma my vaccine magnetism bois tho pls
"The telegram groups are already commenting about ‚Äúcountersue‚Äù-ing should they get issued with POFMA so that they can ‚Äúask them to prove this in a courtroom‚Äù, with somebody replying that that would be a ‚Äúgood idea‚Äù so that all the ‚Äúfacts will be laid bare‚Äù. 

Like they honestly believe that they‚Äôre right and I don‚Äôt know whether to laugh or cry‚Ä¶."
Pogba to Iris Koh
"Now then you ""look into it.""

You could've done this sooner at any point in the timeline since the first CB, but you just had to wait for people to take literal horse pills and push the anti-vaxx agenda too far. 

Who knows, by the time you look finish the virus would've mutated 100 more times and then the vaccine that you have legit dun work alr lol"
"Can eat horse paste, but cannot kp gahmen is it? What are they waiting for?"
"Lai  Liao Lai Liao, see whether certain telegram group membership starts drooping like flies‚Ä¶"
Why use pofma when we can reeducate them instead /s
Do it then. What are you even waiting for?
Yeah 'cos Covid falsehoods not spread by SDP right
"""light at the end of the tunnel""

POFMA cos the tunnel is not ending!!"
How about we pofma them for flip flopping ?
"The actual situation that pofma should be used in, but no"
Only used it to protect themselves. Don't really see it being used on anti vaxxer or boomer WA group
