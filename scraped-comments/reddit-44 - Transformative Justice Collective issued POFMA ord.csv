"once again, a POFMA has been issued without quoting the original text. if it is so clear that a false statement has been made (as some comments in this post seem to suggest) why not quote the offending text for all to see and for the media to report? why is there a need to rewrite the original text before declaring it false?"
"Reading some of the posts, I get the impression the some people are clueless about this organisation. It shows how easily some are misled. Do your homework, trace their history, look into the 2 accounts they use for seeking donations, see the timing and pattern of their actions, read the series of misleading articles and post since inception, their exploitation of prisoners’ families from the lowest income from Malaysia, find out the people behind it.

Their use of language and the way sentences are phrased to carry falsehood.

Their aim is not to convince Singaporeans. Their target audience is the western liberal foreign press and one in particular benefits from it financially."
"TJC always shoots themselves in the foot with the advocacy that they are doing. They don't provide evidence to backup their claims, don't try to convince middle ground people who they should be heard, Block comments on their Instagram and often engage in antagonist leaning arguments. 

It makes them hard to be well liked and often attract people of a certain demographic unfortunately."
"Much ado over nothing. TJC are a fringe group of loonies anyway, and easily discredited by their own emotive statements. It is a waste of effort to POFMA them"
Quite disturbing that most of their supporters don’t appear to be local. And pushing extremist left-wing views like one-sided trotting out of Hamas talking points. Fits the definition of woke.
"Whatever you think about the death penalty, the POFMA response to TJC attributed statements to them that, in my view, they did not actually make. I'd encourage people to read both what TJC wrote, and the POFMA response against it.


What a farce. "
They should have provided the data and other evidence instead of just giving blanket statements. What does it mean by not enough time to prepare? There has to be a comparison of what’s the norm in Singapore.
I’m not a fan of the TJC but this feels a bit much.
Look at all you blood-thirsty people here
