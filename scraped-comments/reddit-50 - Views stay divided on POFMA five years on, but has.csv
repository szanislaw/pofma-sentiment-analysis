"If you really want to POFMA, use it on false advertising. That would be a true protection without any political connotations.

Yes, Sterra, that includes you."
"Putting aside the very important question about how a law like POFMA could be used for political purposes, there's very little doubt in my mind that not only does POFMA completely fail to tackle misinformation, it actually makes the misinformation landscape in Singapore significantly **worse**. I'm actually convinced that POFMA is going to go down one day in communications and public policy textbooks as a case study in how a failure to understand how misinformation works leads to ineffective and harmful public policy.

POFMA inevitably fails because it doesn't understand how misinformation spreads, and there are four main areas where POFMA exacerbates and promotes misinformation.

1. The Streisand Effect - This idea is quite well known around internet circles, but for the uninitated, the Streisand effect describes how acts to block or censor a obscure piece of information often backfires by creating awareness about it. The term was created when the singer/actress Barbara Streisand attempted to prevent the publication of a photograph showing her house in an obscure photograph documenting coastal erosion in California - which inevitably drew far greater attention to the photograph which would have otherwise likely gone unnoticed. Because of how POFMA works, reporters from the mainstream media often notice immediately when a POFMA order is issued, and this inevitably draws more attention to the piece of misinformation.

2. Confirmation by omission. Let's say that there's a piece of misinformation out there that is clearly false and clearly harmful, but for one reason or another, it hasn't attracted a POFMA notice yet. If we understand that both POFMA and this piece of misinformation exist at the same time, the seemingly rational response we might have then is that this piece of misinformation must be true (if not why hasn't it been POFMA'd yet?). Obviously this is specious reasoning - there is a ton of misinformation out there, and there is no way that all of it can be captured (which we will discuss later in point 4), but it nonetheless forms the basis of how some prominent - let's call them influencers - peddle their work. For example, Iris Koh often advertises the information she sends out as being 'POFMA-free'. But I would argue that even if the government would POFMA all these cases, I don't think this would help in preventing the spread of misinformation anyway, which leads me to point 3. 

3. Confirmation by inclusion. Let's say the opposite is now true, and that piece of misinformation is instead POFMA'd. Obviously, if that piece of misinformation is absurd enough, you probably wouldn't have even given it the time of day to begin with, but consider what it would be like if you were the type of person predisposed to believing this sort of misinformation. If you're the type of person that believes that the COVID vaccine has graphene-based nanomachines that control a person under the influence of 5G, you're probably also predisposed to the idea that the government lies to you - and the fact that the government is now suppressing this information via a POFMA order should reinforce rather than deny that this information is correct. There is a very small intersection of people who POFMA would actually work to convince had it otherwise not been implemented, and I woudl argue that this intersection could be reached in other ways not nearly as harmful as POFMA.


4. The dispersed nature of misinformation - Even if the above 3 were not true, POFMA is fundamentally ineffective because the way that misinformation is spread and consumed is often dispersed. We don't just consume misinformation from a blog or a post, it often comes from a single forwarded message, or a twitter post that you saw off hand, or a telegram channel. Misinformation is a downpour not an asteroid. POFMA inevitably fails because it's designed to work against single pieces of misinformation from an identified (usually local) source. To date, there have been 72 cases where POFMA has been used in its history. Think about how many bogus whatsapp messages you receive from your grandma each day, and you immediately know the problem."
I thought the views were pretty aligned that the pofma is used by the gahmen to mainly  silence the opposition?
"Shut down the bloody department lah. 

If they want to shut down their political rivals, they should use their own pocket money instead of taxpayers' monies."
It has helped our ministers shirk all discourse by slapping every little technicality with the law of course
"It sounds good on paper, but not in implementation. That is the Singapore story for many areas actually. 

Here’s my takeaway from the article:

In this year alone, out of the 15 cases that involved the use of POFMA, 14 had targeted these groups or individuals.

Of the 14, nine were political party members or former members who had contested in elections against PAP."
It’s quite handy for the Boi Sai Gong party.
"With POFMA, you need to have a counterbalance to make sure it doesn't get abused so easily. Pofma comes with fine or jail time or both, so the abuse of pofma should have the same punishment. Ministers are the ones who approach the pofma office to issue pofma, so they should be the one taking responsibility"
"It is the most useless law ever. People will still believe what they want to believe, pofma or no pofma. People have brains to think and put two and two together."
"Divided? More like majority disagree, but the few who benefits from it wants to keep it intact and calls it “divided”."
"Views stay divided.


Common people like us find it useless.


Politicians find it useful."
"POFMA is not a slap on the wrist. When issued POFMA, most will comply w the order because it's really very expensive to dispute the facts. $20k fine or 12 months prison for individuals and $500,000 for organisations."
"In most cases, when POFMA is issued, any reasonably discerning person should think,  ""There is some inconvenient truth here, stated slightly imprecisely, that the government is trying to suppress in its own interest."" It's your job as a thinking voter with a functioning brain to determine what that inconvenient truth is. "
"I remember someone making a post here during COVID period / nearing GE2021 breaking down the use of POFMA into categories.

From what I recall of the post, nearly all POFMA issued pre-COVID are related to politicians or policy.

Of course, after COVID a ton of POFMA were issued to anti-vax idiots spreading falsehoods about the vaccines."
"As a political tool, I feel that POFMA is a double edge sword. We have already seen that there are times where the comments are just saying 'No POFMA means it's true'"
"Unfortunately pofma while on paper sounds good, in practise its just become a politcal tool."
The fake news is that it is used to combat fake news. We all know what it's really used for ;)
Not really. It's more of an opposition silencing tool.
P in POFMA doesn't stand for politics. So apply it not only for politics
POFMA has ZERO credibility.
"CNA missed the point here. It feels like they're being used as a red herring to distract from the red issue. If they really want to be objective and ask hard questions, they would be looking at the actual pain points in the POFMA debates in Parliament. 

The key to the issue **is not** the fact that POFMA should exist - there is a general consensus that a form of fact-checking is good for society in this era of misinformation. Despite the title and the mixed reactions from the interviewees, the way CNA angled the article frames a false dichotomy between whether POFMA should exist or not.

The key to the issue is whether **POFMA should exist under the auspices of a political appointee, i.e. Ministers.** This was not addressed at all in the article - honestly subpar journalism."
Of course it stays divided when you wrote most of part of the article towards the positive light of it. These experts are just mouthpiece.
POFMA has been misused to silence any views that do not reflect the prevailing narrative. We are slow walking to become a North Korea aka boiled frog.
News that gov doesn't POFMA are real. Including those mentioned by opposition.
i don’t think POFMA has helped. but i’m also curious to see what credible alternatives redditors can propose?
Where got divided???
"Title: Views stay divided on POFMA five years on, but has it helped in tackling fake news? 

There was an error reading the article text. This may be due to a paywall.

useless
I hate the thought that people of such important position are wasting time chasing after every little misinformation. I rather they spend the time monitoring so it could turn into action some day.
Listen to the ministry of truth. Their narrative is the only narrative allowed. Why you ask? It's the ministry of truth. Surely they wouldn't say anything other than the truth?!
It has worked like a charm for the powers that be
"It's a political tool.

Sterra is still around with fake advertisements and claims."
Didn’t we get to use it against anti-vaxxers?
