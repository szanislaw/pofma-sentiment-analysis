Lol. Another gaslighting article by the Party Against People mouthpieces.
"Where are the customary ""according to experts"" and ""according to a survey conducted by the international organization"".....? That's their SOP right?"
why PAP members never kena POFMA before?
Majority means PAP and it's supporters which I guess technically it is accurate?
Statistics can be easily manipulated via selective biased sampling. This is universally known.
"In other news, forest fires prevents poaching."
"It depends on who they ask. This kind of news from gahment voice boxes are skewed to the gahment’s intent. 
If you really believe think why you believe and if you don’t also think why you do not. 
I suggest thinking it from both sides and see what you get when your arguments reach the middle.
A example will be China’s news media is monopolistic and never says bad things so as to influence innocent audiences to their agendas.
Therefore we got to equipped ourselves with critical thinking  abilities so we can see with clarity.
On a side note i always think why critical thinking and ethics/moral studies are not thought in schools."
"also suppress our Freedom
No wonder

Gaslighting for sure. We all know that
Can ownself POFMA ownself?
"Look CNA, Today under MEDIACORPSE, under Temasek are bespoke advertising propagandist arm of the PAP. Need we say more. It's highly biased and unbalanced when they hardly report anything of the oppo unless it's negative or forced to because it's GE.

The facts speaks for itself."
"Majority of my girlfriends agree I have a big cock. Majority of them say I taste very delicious. I ask them this whenever it comes time to give them tip, they all agree, hence it must be true. 

Same with this stupid article."
