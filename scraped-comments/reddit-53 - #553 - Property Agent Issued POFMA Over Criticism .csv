"A property agent has been POFMAed for a video that made false claims  about the HDB’s Ethnic Integration Policy. We analysed the video and the POFMA order to try and figure out the truth. Elsewhere, a series of social media posts by the Ministry of Finance featuring images of Singaporean families generated by AI, has drawn flak from online commenters. Why the outrage over some AI images?

"Think it's fine to critique the original video on what personal interests the property agent did or didn't disclose.

I find it plain wrong that POFMA is now just accepted as something a minister can use to force a publisher to disclose more context about an issue, rather than simply correct falsehoods. If context was missing, shouldn't the ministry or minister be the one issuing statements on their own platforms to convince people why their argument is stronger?"
"I think the bigger issue that everyone seem to be forgetting or overlooking is that HDB flats now are so outrageously priced and being sold for a profit which is why EIP is now an issue. With high prices, people perceive that they are losing out cos to be honest minorities do have a smaller pool to sell to. If HDB prices are actually much lower like how it was before we start seeing them as assets then EIP would not be an issue."
"Hi guys... thanks for looking at this issue.. it is a very relevant topic for discussion (The POFMA issue). I honestly feel the ministry, did the right thing in getting the POFMA out and setting the records right, especially in this age of misinformation, that gets out of hand easily, globally. And also a big thanks to the ministry concerned to have spent efforts to, setting the POFMA and explain (clarification - explain the effects of our EIP scheme) so that us sg citizens are not misled... our EIP scheme is actually so good, that studies are being conducted on it, as Terence pointed out. So Yes, to the POFMA, Yes, to the clarifications, and Yes, to EIP. In fact, it is so good, that i wish for it to be extended to the private residential, housing market. Last i checked, this market is also situated in Singapore. So the benefits of our celebrated EIP can be extended to this market and serve the bigger purpose and good for our Singapore, amongst others stopping ethnic enclaves. I also wonder why we have not extended it to that market, since 1989 (thanks for the right year - POFMA), since people form the minority race, like myself can benefit from that system, also in the private market, - I feel somewhat unconvinced now, when it is not in that market - our EIP system. Basically, action is better than words (Clarifications)..."
Terence focuses a lot on the benefits of EIP and how he is educated through POFMA's interference. But ask yourselves should POFMA start ascribing intention to an individual to implied non-spoken words. That's the point.
"Great point by Haresh about POFMA and what counts as a 'statement of fact' - made me pause the podcast and watch the said video 3 times over, and scan through a text transcript of the video.

&gt; ...on YouTube on 25 July 2024, contains the following false statements of fact regarding the Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP) | [https://www.gov.sg/article/factually010824](https://www.gov.sg/article/factually010824)

&gt; The POFMA Direction is being issued for the following two false statements of fact: ... Mr Shaik Amar’s assertion that the EIP does not benefit ethnic minority | [https://www.mnd.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/view/issuance-of-correction-direction-under-the-protection-from-online-falsehoods-and-manipulation-act-on-falsehoods-on-ethnic-integration-policy](https://www.mnd.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/view/issuance-of-correction-direction-under-the-protection-from-online-falsehoods-and-manipulation-act-on-falsehoods-on-ethnic-integration-policy)

Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act 2019, Section 2 - General interpretation 

2-(1) ... “statement” means any word (including abbreviation and initial), number, image (moving or otherwise), sound, symbol or other representation, or a combination of any of these | 

(2)  In this Act — (a) a statement of fact is a statement which a reasonable person seeing, hearing or otherwise perceiving it would consider to be a representation of fact; and (b) a statement is false if it is false or misleading, whether wholly or in part, and whether on its own or in the context in which it appears.

Using the POFMA definition of what is defined as a statement of fact, I would argue that a reasonable person would not have drawn the conclusion that ""The EIP offers NO benefit to ethnic minority households"". 

Logic: EIP promotes racial harmony -&gt; Racial harmony benefits society -&gt; ethnic minority households are a subset of society as a whole -&gt; Therefore, ethnic minority households benefit from EIP (i.e. non-zero).

I think that a statement of fact should refer to explicit statement, and, as MND distinguished in its press release, an assertion is an implied statement. I mean, in the spirit of combating falsehoods and manipulation, bucketing assertions into an umbrella of 'statement of fact' is misleading - at best, confusing; at worst, open to abuse."
