"So what if the Ridout Road inquiries were led by the ministers' colleagues (and friends)? I'm not surprised they know each other personally, or are even on friendly terms. LKY admired Teh Cheang Wan a lot until the latter's corrupt acts came to light.

Yes, maybe their fellow minister friends headed the inquiries. But they also need to order people below them to do the dirty work. No lower-level civil servant has ever made a police report to say that Minister XYZ interfered with the investigation process. 

And there is nothing wrong with ""ownself check ownself"". All organisations have to do that to keep themselves clean. Unfortunately, Oppie parties can't check on themselves, which is why they have clowns as party chiefs all the time without kicking them out when they say something dumb."
