It’s weird that tiktok has the obligation but douyin doesn’t. And majority of the elderly use douyin instead of tiktok. Douyin and xiaohongshu should be gazetted as well.,NEG

"Given the way that POFMAs have been used and what our government considers “misinformation”, the entire bill is very worrying. 

This is taking one step closer towards a closed Internet where only government propaganda is permitted.",NEG

"&gt; # TikTok added to list of Internet companies with additional Pofma responsibilities

&gt; SINGAPORE —Short video-sharing app TikTok will now have additional obligations to help combat fake news, including preventing abuse by bots and ensuring online transparency for political advertising under Singapore’s fake news law.

&gt; On Tuesday, the app was added to a list of platforms liable to execute these obligations, joining other popular Internet companies which run social media apps, such as Meta, Twitter, Baidu and WeChat, in this role.

&gt; In response to queries from The Straits Times, the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (Pofma) Office said it and the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) regularly review the list of prescribed Internet intermediaries under Pofma to ensure that the list is kept up to date.

&gt; It said: “As part of this regular review, TikTok has been gazetted as a prescribed Internet intermediary with effect from March 7, 2023 and the Pofma Office has engaged TikTok on these additional obligations.”

&gt; It added that some prescribed Internet intermediaries have additional obligations, which will ensure that these platforms put in place requisite systems and processes to minimise the spread of falsehoods.

&gt; In response to queries, TikTok, which is owned by Chinese tech company ByteDance, said it has been engaging with the Pofma Office throughout this process.

&gt; It added: “Misinformation is an industry-wide challenge no platform can ignore and TikTok is committed to protecting the integrity of our platform.”

&gt; As an Internet intermediary, TikTok can be asked to tag misleading information with notices, as well as restrict Singaporeans’ access to content from specific users.

&gt; It will also have to follow three codes of practice: to give prominence to credible online sources of information, commit to transparency for online political advertisements, and prevent the abuse of fake accounts and bots.

&gt; TikTok arrived in Singapore in 2018. It carries videos up to 10 minutes long, which users navigate by swiping up or down on their smartphones.

&gt; The videos range from dance trends to viral memes, but also cover serious educational content, lifestyle, fashion, politics and news.

&gt; It is extremely popular in Singapore and the world, especially among younger people. Data from public opinion company YouGov showed about 41 per cent of people in Singapore aged between 18 and 24 had used the app in October 2022. This compares favourably with more established apps like Instagram, which started in 2010, and Facebook, which goes back to 2004.
