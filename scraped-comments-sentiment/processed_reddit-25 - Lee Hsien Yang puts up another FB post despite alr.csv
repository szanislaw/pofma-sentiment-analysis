This Dude POFMA-ed the POFMA. What happens next? Will the POFMA POFMA his POFMA of the POFMA?,NEU
POFMA always works. Unless the POFMA-ED is rich and powerful.,NEU
Well changing SPH to SPH trust doesn’t clean the shit that are all over the walls after it hits the fan. SPH operates as it is for many years even with the name change.,NEG
He is doing what Han and others are doing. They post POFMA notice and the link to the Govt version of events but double down on what they are saying. So both versions are available. He avoided SPH Trust this time as it now a separate entity.,NEU
"What grinds my gears about the POFMA notice is that it kept harping on about how the expensive renovations were required and not due to the tenants being ministers and I'm like fark lah, I don't care who the tenants are, why are you guys rubbing in our faces that it's necessary to use a large chunk of taxpayers' money to maintain properties that only the rich can afford to stay in.

If you tell me that there is a national lottery system where any citizen can take part in to win a chance at staying in these properties for a month, then I can see the logic in using taxpayers money to maintain them.",NEG
POFMA notice: the said post that Lee Hsien Yang stands by has already been POFMA-ed,NEU
POFMA liao then what? The man is not even in Singapore lol.,NEU
"POFMA the POFMA the POFMA the POFMA..... never ending. Those issuing the POFMA really childish. They thought they can set the perception , their version of truth to us by issuing POFMA?",NEG
POFMA: come back home and say it.,NEU
"ABSD/SSD - a pertinent issue, MND must focus on the Limited numbers of Heritage/conservation shophouses (already gone out of hand, must rein in urgently) by implementing immediately ABSD and SSD which are chased and FLIPPED by the ULTRA RICH Foreigners/locals/ family institutions, large institutions and collective purchases by agents (sharing ownership)  
  
94 Amoy street bought in nov 2022 and FLIPPED in april 2023 because of no SSD, made 3 million dollars plus.  
  
  
FLIPPING measure was mitigated on Private properties due to multiple ownerships and ever rising prices albeit slowly nowadays instead of a ""High Jump', however FLIPPING has been circumvented by these multiple ultra rich foreigners and locals and invest in shophouses. Failure on the absd/ssd implementation indeed lead to the national coffers with less money  
  
  
  
F&amp;B tenants been suffering madly in the hot kitchen to make some money, rest goes to absurdly high rent, many are dependent on their culinary skills to whip up good food yet got to compromise on the food servings to survive, got to work extremely hard to pay rent, some had to give up, recent irene ang's thai cafe due to absurd high rent closed up  
  
  
  
MND regulator must act without further delay  
  
  
  
Lets keep fingers crossed that these ABSD and SSD would be implemented immediately and it will also contribute to the nation's coffers to use it for the if possible free medical, support hospital expenses, raise higher wages for nurses who work hard to ensure patients' well being, more support to the elderly and retirees, low wage workers, hdb dwellers, more BTO subsidies since the prices have also gone through the roof

This LHL seriously got problem in his brain. Keep attacking his own brother. Can’t even manage his subordinates fucking.,NEG
lky: errrr,NEU
Surprise UNO Reverse!,POS
"What is the use of POFMA? Just fine him gao gao or jail him if he really spoke the untruth. Anyway, if I remember correctly that LHY once said that he is not under oath and he can say anything he wants.",NEG
How come sg become washing machine.,NEU
