"This is the POFMA special: Somebody will say ""we observed X, which suggests Y bad thing about the government's policies.""

Shanmugan or some other minister, but usually Shanmugan, will then start flinging out POFMA corrections that say ""actually, it's not Y, because of Z"" but *Y is an opinion and X is still true*.

Take the Ridout saga, for example. Several people said ""the ministers got the houses for super cheap and the government basically cleared trees for them, seems kinda sus"". Then the government swings in with ""actually, not sus because we cleared ourselves"" *but we can still see with our eyes that it looks sus,* and the government basically let themselves off the hook with a piece of legalese (which they have the authority to write).

It's all very silly and reeks of desperation.",NEG
"wait wait wait… so the govt(pap) can suka amend constitution? 

Do the citizens have any power on this?

Edit:
Okie thanks all.
My brain just become a little bit less noob",NEG
"It's an interesting question when a matter is more opinion than fact. 

The statement under fire is something like ""Prisoners that are executed while ongoing legal proceedings are not afforded due process."" 

Is this a statement or an opinion? Seems to me like an opinion. But POFMA is treating it like a false statement. 

But it's like saying ""HDB prices are expensive"". I think that's an opinion, because what you determine to be ""expensive"" is subjective. Same goes with ""due process"". Some people will think as long as they went through one judgement is enough ""due process"". Others might think they should be given the right to appeal that judgement.",NEU
I strongly believe that Shanmugam's viewpoint about just simply amending the Constitution to suit his or PAP's needs is common among that party. They have been in power so long that they think they are infallible and are all powerful. We need to make sure to vote these fuckers out.,NEU
"POFMA is used to quell critics more than to correct misinformation, we already know this.",NEU
The civil servant presiding over this prob swore ...have to OT again..,NEG

"Dear Minister Shanmugam, if you are seeing this, here is a summary of[ the video on ""Facts and Opinions For Kids""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE_TPYdCssA) specially made for you!

# Summary

This video teaches kids the difference between facts and opinions, using relatable examples and emphasizing the importance of understanding both.

# Highlights

* 🍕 Andrew loves pizza, but his parents have different favourite foods.
* 🌈 Facts can be proven, like the sky being blue.
* 🏖️ Opinions are subjective, like which season is best.
* 👩‍🏫 Mrs. Jones is a nice teacher, but that’s an opinion.
* 📊 Knowing facts helps make informed decisions, like buying a game.
* 🗣️ Listening to opinions fosters understanding among people.
* 🔍 Researching facts is essential to clarify misinformation.

# Key Insights

* 🍕 U**nderstanding Preferences:** Everyone has different tastes, as shown by Andrew and his parents’ food preferences. This highlights that opinions vary from person to person.
* 🌈 P**roving Facts:** Facts are objective and can be verified, such as weather conditions, which helps establish a baseline for knowledge.
* 🏖️ S**ubjective Nature of Opinions:** Statements about what is “best” are opinions, emphasizing that preferences are personal and not universally applicable.
* 👩‍🏫 Su**pportive Opinions: O**pinions can be supported by facts, demonstrating that reasoning can strengthen personal beliefs.
* 📊 M**aking Informed Choices:** Knowing factual information assists in making decisions, such as budgeting for a purchase, which is practical for kids.
* 🗣️ R**espectful Dialogue:** Engaging with others’ opinions promotes respect and understanding, essential for social interactions.
* 🔍 I**mportance of Research:** Distinguishing facts from false statements requires research, fostering critical thinking skills in children.

Is it still too long? Here is an even more condensed version for you written by a five-year-old:

&gt;In this video, I discover how to tell facts from opinions. Facts are things I can prove, like ""the sky is blue"" or the weather outside, while opinions are personal preferences, like what food or season I think is the best. Understanding this difference helps me make smarter decisions, like when I'm deciding what game to buy. It also teaches me to listen to other people's opinions with respect, even if I don't agree with them. Plus, I learn the importance of doing my own research to make sure what I believe is really true. Yay yay yay!

I hope this spoon-feeding helps you. As always, please feel free to ask if you have further questions. I believe this community would be very willing to help 😊",NEU

"Shan gonna be fucking salty. Kids, this is why you need to deny PAP the supermajority, so they can't fuck with the constitution.",NEG
"Vote for more alternatives in Parliament for checks and balances, accountability and transparency.

No more blank cheques and the sanctity of the Constitution be consistent and maintained.",NEU
"tbh, good luck with that shit",NEG
"They are playing around with words knowing full well that most lay Singaporeans do not understand the legal system. As usual no identifiable spokesperson.

The approach has always been to wait for the 11th hour so it becomes an international issue and foreigners and even Singaporeans think the Courts have no time to make a proper and reasonable decision. These people have been on death row for a number of years, not weeks, not months etc, All the proper appeals have been lodged and dismissed but these last minute claims on new material and evidence (when they are not) is done on purpose .",NEG
Hang on lemme grab some popcorn.,NEU
"In desperation, the people on death row keep appealing, post appealing and post post appealing. When you don’t think of other people whom you have hurt/killed (and their families life destroyed) when you do stupid stuff, and now you want others to think about you. Good luck to you.",NEG

"Heard on 26th, dismissed on 30th.

Ok so how inefficient do you want it to be? It's not like our criminal courts are that busy. Got time to clear cases, clear lor 🙄

If busy until next year, review next year.

If free today, review today. What's the problem?

You submit application, you should expect to get results ASAP. Why you demanding the courts to drag their feet?",NEG
Very brave of TJC. If only more people would voice out instead of bending over and accepting the status quo so easily.,POS
"Isn’t this the group that argues drugs are less harmful than perceived and should be decriminalized?

And allowing drug trafficking without severe penalties, like the death penalty, is akin to granting a free visa to those who want to bring drugs into Singapore, leading to an influx of traffickers.",NEG
"Point is they stated there was no regard for due process and the death penalty was being used arbitrarily. Those are not opinions, they are statements of fact. And therefore open to being POFMAed. Just take your medicine and word your posts more carefully in future.",NEG
"If I remember correctly PAP has changed the constitution 50+ times since they have been in power. I read this somewhere so don't come after me. If anyone has source it will be greatly appreciated. To me the last one about changing president one retroactively was the most disgusting.in my opinion, We got moonlighting president to further his personal ambitions of grandeur while collecting tax payer funded paycheck. I lost all respect for that tharman when he didn't have the balls to say it before he walked over to his throne. This govt and it's ministers are just looking out for themselves and are incompetent bafoons. If sgporeans don't give them a wake up call we will be going down the same path as those countries we make fun of",NEG
"Soon the physical remains of Lao Lee will manifest and assimilate due to sheer outrage and the course of our mighty nation will be righted, with some righteous indignation and comeuppance meted out generously.

Why do they keep defending these drug traffickers? Many Singaporeans (myself included) support the death penalty for drug trafficking.,NEG
"Amending the Constitution so that they do not have to explain, debate or argue in Parliament, their ideas, and bestow upon themselves (or himself, in the case of Shanmugan) immense power.

The power to:

1. Do anything, against anyone.
2. Silence anyone.
3. Write history.
4. Force anyone to accept 1 to 3.",NEU
"lol. If they didn’t remove the original post and put up the POFMA correction then TJS gg liao. 

You can disagree with minister’s interpretation of POFMA but the law compels you to take down first then argue in court later.

Edit: 

I’m wrong only a correction order was issued, not stop communication order. But even then they need to put up the correction already instead of arguing.",NEG
