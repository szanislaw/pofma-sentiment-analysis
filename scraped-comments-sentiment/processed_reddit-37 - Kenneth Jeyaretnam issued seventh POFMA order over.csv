"is it the policy of the government to use POFMA as a first response or a last resort? what are the precise criteria for the use of POFMA given ""misinformation"" from far more influential publications have recieved a much more gentle response? I refer to examples such as TODAY's ""misleading"" article about NAC, or the Financial Times article which MAS claimed was false. 

these are the questions MPs should be asking, instead of making wayang beebo speeches",NEU
"&gt; If any or all of this is not true then I‚Äôm sure Singaporeans would welcome Shan‚Äôs clarification.

I find it concerning that POFMA is used as a proxy for Shanmugam's clarification. He could very easily have issued a clarification either on his personal profile or via MinLaw, as is the norm. 

But the fact that he just chose to POFMA - and only part of the facts at that - speaks volumes of his modus operandi.  Very much ""rules for thee but not for me, I can just use the heaviest weapon I have to mow down KJ"".",NEG

I find it hard to relate to shan QQing from the comfort of his ridout road b/w.",NEG
"From KJ's facebook post, the para that was POFMAed

""In this case nonly have Vivian and Shan not stepped down but Shan is Law Minister and thus under the Singapore system may have some input, along with the PM, into the appointment and promotion of High Court judges and into the size of their performance bonuses which I understand can be up to 3 months salary. If any or all of this is not true then I‚Äôm sure Singaporeans would welcome Shan‚Äôs clarification.  ""

I guess the POFMA clarified that per the relevant acts, the MPs decide the renumeration of the justices, the bonuses determined by the CJ, also the package can't go down after appointment.

the word may have some input doesn't mean determine. The act is clear - the CJ is the one who determines. Does it mean that the influence of the PM and Shan play a part in both the legislature as well as their relationship with the CJ? Well i don't think the POFMA actually addresses that point. 

But of course the onus is on KJ to provide substantive proof (e.g. a history of incidences that has led him to that conclusion) The issue is that he probably doesn't. But should he actually be asking for a FOIA act so that at least parliamentarians can request for such information since there is no investigative journalism in Singapore.",NEU
A bit weird that judges (and politicians) receive performance bonuses.,NEG
"When there is no FOIA, some parties might choose to use this as a reverse tool. If something doesn‚Äôt get POFMA-ed, they assume it to be credible.",NEU
Why can‚Äôt it just be a clarification? What is with the use of PoFMA,NEG
how much judge earn ah...so power,NEU
Should he be awarded a lifetime achievement upon getting his 10th POFMA?,NEU
"I just realised that KJ lives in the UK..? But if he's the sec-gen of a political party here, shouldn't be be living here? Cos if he gets elected, would he move here or continue staying in the UK?",NEU

"‚ÄúSecond Minister for Law Edwin Tong, who is also Minister for Culture, Community and Youth, instructed the POFMA Office to issue the order to Mr Jeyaretnam, the Ministry of Law said in a media release.‚Äù 

Ma man ET is doing the work of God. So proud of him!!",NEU
"The PM should just sue him. If not, the courts should take action. How many times has he uttered such defamatory remarks accusing the government already? 

Does he get paid for collecting POFMA orders or are the People's Alliance leaders engaged in a friendly competition with one another to see who can collect the most POFMA orders?",NEG
"‚ÄúAn article on the government's fact-checking website Factually said that this is untrue.‚Äù

Well if the government says it‚Äôs untrue, then it MUST be untrue. Hahahaha",NEU
"So I‚Äôm just wondering:

‚Äú""Under Article 98(6) of the Constitution, the legislature shall by law provide for the remuneration of the Supreme Court judges,"" the article said.‚Äù

And the prime minister is the leader of the legislature. So technically what he said is correct that the PM can influence the bonus (remuneration)?",NEU
