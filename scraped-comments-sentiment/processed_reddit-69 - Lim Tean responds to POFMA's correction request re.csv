"His post literally stated that $167m was spent on local bursaries and grants, he never mentioned it was the whole education budget. Strangely enough POFMA is better at bringing up inconvenient facts to a wider audience than actually fighting fake news...",NEU
"Most days Lim Tean whines and nobody says a word.

Now he has full-blast media coverage from multiple mainstream newspapers. What’s funny is he’s actually 100% accurate on this rare occasion.

Eventually the government will learn to use POFMA with more finesse. So far their correction notices have been really poorly targeted (and worded).

But until then I think they will only succeed in providing more free media coverage to their political enemies.",NEG
"Factually correct.

But the framing is misleading. The bursaries and grants for local students are much higher than the MOE's budget of $167M. There are other government and quasi-government bursaries and grants for local students which are not accessible to foreigners.

POFMA should not be used since the facts are correct. Otherwise, POFMA will be overreaching.",NEU
Govt should pofma the ntu girl who made false report.,NEG
I don't like Lim Tean but it appears that this is an obvious overreach of POFMA and should be challenged.,NEG
"People talking about A

Govt reply about B and says A is false. 

Apple for Apple obviously scholarship for foreigners vs locals. Why will you even compare scholarship for foreigners vs total budget?


EDIT::

In case people are curious why this was given POFMA - uni scholarship is always a sensitive topic.

Updated - of local cohort 
Why - 30% of local cohort or lesser allotted for Singapore students until recently the decision to build more uni and gradually raise it to 40%. Our local born students have to go overseas uni ($$$). Those with no money, have their jobs taken by foreigners with degrees. And you have foreigners who do free degrees? Outrage

Scholarships given out by the Govt - some students migrate to other countries etc or do not repay the loan. MOE has weak controls to enforce such cases. The scholarship is also, in my opinion, easier to get vs local scholarship. 

Postgraduate foreigner study obligation - why is this even a thing? The Govt is quietly removing this for all foreigner  postgrads so now they have the pay full price (which they should for post graduate). 

Always talking about primary to secondary school get subsided education worth tens of thousands. Ok I get it this is good. But every developed country has it. Nothing to sound the trumpets over on 2019. 

Over the years MOE has been reducing such foreign scholarships due to in my opinion (don’t POFMA me) bad optics and lightning rod raised by opposition. Lim Tean raising this again is opening the skeleton closet.",NEU
"Someone else pointed out POFMA = Preventing Opposition From Making Accusations. 

In this case, i see why now.",NEU
"POFMA is the kind of act that is amazingly idiotic yet useful at the same time. 

I guess if they are smart, they should have used it judiciously and surgically but no, POFMA is way easier to use as a sledgehammer for this government.",NEG
"Isn’t it misleading that he is focusing on the scholarship figures though? Every local student is subsidized heavily, just not necessarily through scholarships or bursaries. Our fees would be much higher to begin with without the subsidies. Overall spending figures should be used instead. 

We don’t just want r/technicallycorrect shit stirrers, it’s also important to be comprehensive and avoid misleading perspectives.",NEG
"Was it mentioned, was the amount stated what MOE set aside for locals, or was it the cost last year? 

Scholarships are meant to be for the achievers for that cohort. It doesn't mean that more budget allocate for scholarships means that we would have more scholarships handled out to local students. Scholarships would really lose their meaning if that was the case.

Bursaries and grants are grouped together as finanical support. These are not automatically granted to students are they need to apply and then only they will process it. MOE bursaries are really easy to get, I can tell because I received it suring my studies in Uni. However it is really not known to most students that need it or it is too troublesome because you have to show proof of income per household. If the process is easier or avocated by schools more, I am sure there would actually be more students taking it.

Just my 2 cents",NEU
"Correct me if i am wrong but isn't it because that the fees for locals are significantly (in the multiples) lesser than foreigners so that amount actually benefited way more locals than foreigners, impact wise?",NEU
"If the education system encourages critical thinking, will we still need POFMA?

IMO PAP is a decent government and it has become more and more difficult to get the right information across. I don't think POFMA is the right answer. 

I think there is a disjoint between the ruling elites and the ground. The answer should be going back to the roots by building a strong grassroot layer and explaining more to the people the important issues of the day.",NEU
"sigh. just gonna say that I think this is right use of POFMA and lim tean should just stop framing his arguments in such a manner :( 

why stir shit sia

this is not even worth ""online discourse"" on",NEU
"If a non-PAP govt does come to power, I feel POFMA should stick around until all skeletons from the current ruling party's closet have been taken out and postmortem has been done on them. Don't want the the now-opposition PAP running away easy, do we, by trying all sorts of stunts to ""refute"" that what they have done was in the interests of the nation, when it was done in the interests of their own party and themselves?",NEU
"So my read of this is that...he made a misleading statement, got hit with POFMA due to it being misleading, and instead of addressing the misleading bit of his statement, chooses to double down and label POFMA the crybaby legislation instead...?",NEG
"News report on POFMA here. 4th POFMA request since inception.

Fuck POFMA.",NEU
It is just a matter of perspectives. My girfriend says I am so short. I can say the difference with a taller guy she is going out with is only 4% of his height.,NEU
The Sg governments plan to brain drain other countries talent. Why do they need to do this? Its so tiresome.,NEG
It's good to know that Lim Tean will not be elected.,NEU
"I’ve been pretty outraged about this for so Long.

Many of my friends who don’t perform too well but still average out for their studies can’t even get into the Uni courses they want.  Imagine being born in a country, but not being able to access our facilities and resources.  Priority should be given to Singaporeans.",NEG
