"What is the point of the POFMA even?

EDMW for instance were reporting what the minister said and roasting the CM for it.

It be like if Colbert did a segment, highlighted what the Delhi CM said and then roasted him but got slapped with a POFMA for ""spreading falsehoods"".",NEG

"Lol this government is a bloody joke.

India was the one that said singapore virus.

"*There is a false statement circulating online by multiple media outlets and social media platforms, which implies that a new, previously unknown variant of COVID-19 originated in Singapore and/or risks spreading to India from Singapore.*

***Facts***

*This is false. There is no new “Singapore” variant of COVID 19. Neither is there evidence of any COVID-19 variant that is ‘extremely dangerous for kids’. The strain that is prevalent in many of the COVID-19 cases detected in Singapore in recent weeks is the B.1.617.2 variant, which originated from India. The existence and spread of the B.1.617.2 variant within India predates the detection of the variant in Singapore, and this has been publicly known and reported by various media sources from as early as 5 May 2021.*",NEG

"This question is a bit out-of-topic but I am having a very hard time understanding how the Correction Order actually works.

I accept that transmission of falsehoods should be stopped but weren't some of the articles being shared on HWZ, facebook and twitter originated from the Straits Times website? And also from newspaper websites in India? Wouldn't it be more effective to apply the correction order to these media outlets instead?",NEG
Reddit will tio?,NEU
"Ahh grasping at sands again. Even worse, local forums critical of that stupid SG variant nonce got caught in friendly fire.",NEG
"What is everyone up in arms about? I thought what he did was to get these social media platforms to carry a prompt which makes it very clear (not that we need it, but still...) that there is no SG variant. Kind of like when you watch certain channels on YouTube and there's a prompt that tells you this channel is sponsored in part or whole by some government.

It's just a note to clarify for the readers, no? It's not like he's using pofma to haul people off to jail. It's not a move to punish but to clarify. Am I missing something?",NEU
