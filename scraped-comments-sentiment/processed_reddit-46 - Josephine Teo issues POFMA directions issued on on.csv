&gt;Here are some guidelines for best practices:  
&gt;  
&gt;**You should submit from a variety of sources** (a general rule of thumb is that 10% or less of your posting and conversation should link to your own content), **talk to people in the comments** (and not just on your own links), and **generally be a good member of the community.**

&gt;Feel free to post links to your own content (within reason). **But if that's all you ever post**, or it always seems to get voted down, take a good hard look in the mirror — you just might be a spammer. **A widely used rule of thumb is the 9:1 ratio, i.e. only 1 out of every 10 of your submissions should be your own content.**",NEU
And rightly so for this case,POS
