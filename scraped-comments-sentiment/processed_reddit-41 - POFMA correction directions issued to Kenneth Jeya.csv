"&gt;“Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean also said that Minister K Shanmugam had recused himself, and this meant that he no longer had any duty in the matter. There could thus be no potential or actual conflict of interest.”  
The senior minister also explained how Mr Shanmugam had “removed himself from the chain of command and decision-making process entirely” when it came to the rental of 26 Ridout Road.

Hey team, big boss has removed himself from the decision-making process of this house he's going to rent. Remember to make the decisions as if you don't know he's the tenant, okay?",NEU
"compare the claim made by the POFMA office:

&gt;Jom also claimed the SLA spent more than S$1 million (US$0.76 million) on the renovation of both bungalows because the ministers were tenants.

vs what was actually written:

&gt;In Parliament, Balakrishnan and Shanmugam cried about the sacrifices they made moving into apparently decrepit bungalows. Stories of termites and financial losses, respectively, merited a sandiwara soundtrack. The bare facts are shocking, including over S$1m of taxpayer money spent on renovation works.

does that sound like a fair characterisation? why only provide their own interpretation of what was said, instead of quoting directly from the article itself?",NEU
"Pretty sure jom was targeted because of the quite well-written [legal assessment of the Ridout affair](https://www.jom.media/an-assessment-of-the-ministerial-review-on-the-ridout-bungalow-leases/) by Harpreet Singh.

&gt;MinLaw and MCI said the Jom article omitted important information from what Mr Teo had said in parliament on Jul 3.

&gt;“Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean had expressly clarified that he meant it was important to observe the spirit as well as the letter of the code,” said the ministries.

LMAO, so now if you do an article, you need to make sure you don't miss out a single line that Teo Chee Hean (which, just a reminder, is an involved person in the Ridout affair and shouldn't even be talking from a point of authority) said?

&gt; “Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean also said that Minister K Shanmugam had recused himself, and this meant that he no longer had any duty in the matter. There could thus be no potential or actual conflict of interest.”

&gt; The senior minister also explained how Mr Shanmugam had “removed himself from the chain of command and decision-making process entirely” when it came to the rental of 26 Ridout Road.

Oh, so Teo Chee Hean said K Shanmugam recused himself means no conflict of interest.

Big ""Hey guys, military police is coming on the 8th but y'all pretend y'all don't know about it okay"" energy.

Are SLA staff just supposed to pretend to be retarded?",NEU

"Don't worry about the POFMA. Always see the big picture.

1. 2 MPs cum Ministers elected by the people of Singapore some of whom are in low income brackets are renting prime state owned properties and one is huge, half the size of the Padang. It would reasonable to state that it is a lavish lifestyle reminiscent of days of the British Raj. And certainly in conflict with the spartan image that the ruling govt  projects of itself with its trademark short sleeves and white top and bottom with no ties or suits.
2. At a time when young couples presumably some being their constituents have made up to 13 attempts to get a BTO flat. And they paid 20% upfront.
3. HDB properties have repeatedly broken the million dollar mark in the resale market. Both rental and sale properties are breaking new records. Despite the controls placed.
4. The future looks uncertain for young Singaporeans who have to compete with foreigners in their own country for job not just at high level but at entry level of basic degree holders.

As the Govt of the day, it cannot be ""we are monitoring the situation"".",NEU

"JOM has been scoring on credibility for a while and they are the obvious target. They have to be careful not to be tarnished by the same brushstrokes as others.

"KJ accused pap of so many things over the years. wondering why nvr pofma. got truth? or dunt want to make him famous by pofma. 

but now only pofma him over this specific part. own goal lah. i read orginal article he disclaim that he heard but nvr verify that it was shan son who reno. pls lah. so many accusations against wp during ahtc saga. even shan accuse wp of enriching friends from resident money. but now very sensitive to truth. the hyprocrisy is too much

at least public can be rest assured that everything else on kj website is true. so read up. kj made so many acusations of pap misleading public or conflict of interest and lying about budget reserves etc. would be funny if not that its sinkies who will have to suffer in the end",NEG

"Can't say there's no falsehood in some of the points, but why is Jom given a POFMA for saying $1 million is a lot?",NEG
"The opposition IBs have been heavily shifting goalposts throughout this saga. It went from “the ministers are renting GCBs for way below market rent” to “SLA built free carpark and pool for the ministers” to “SLA paid Shanmugam son, since no POFMA it means it’s true” to “Gov is being overbearing with the POFMA”! Like didn’t you guys asked for POFMA a week ago?

Opposition IBs are grasping at straws and believing claims from the likes of KJ. If only y’all put in this level of scrutiny into the AHTC saga, which by the way, has much more wrongdoings than this",NEU
