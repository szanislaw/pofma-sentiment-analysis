"It is my opinion that POFMA lately is just dancing around words, while ignoring the elephants in the room. 

I in fact do remember this testing incident, and I went to read up on it again. 

As far as I am concerned, Tambyah got the essence of the problem correct as far as part 1 and 2, just not in the most accurate words.

In my opinion, they did attempt to discourage non-emergency testing through the threat of revoking work pass privileges.",NEG
"This shit is exactly why I do not want a pap supermajority. POFMA is a fucking joke and ministers are really shitty arbiters of truth.

So many POFMAs being used to score political points, while the FAP trolls dtill run rampant. Utterly disgusting.",NEG
"Here is a point that has been circulating in Facebook and it deserves our attention.

**Yesterday**, MOM claimed this falsehood and issued POFMA:

""MOM issued a statement to all the employers that if they brought their foreign workers for COVID-19 testing, they **would lose their work pass privileges**.""

However, **on February 19**, MOM stance is clearly about suspending work pass privileges:

""SINGAPORE - Do not send employees to hospitals unless there is a medical emergency, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has warned employers, after hospitals reported that employers were dropping off workers to have them tested for the coronavirus.

""**Employers who act irresponsibly by misusing medical facilities may have their work pass privileges suspended,"" it added.**""

Here is the source from The Straits Times: [https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/manpower/coronavirus-mom-warns-employers-not-to-send-workers-who-are-well-to-hospitals-for?fbclid=IwAR3mg8r1ggqyCcfbkkZWk2EmE4F\_dsMOHSlM0iEBVJ1BnmJ-Ez7Kaixn\_Eg](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/manpower/coronavirus-mom-warns-employers-not-to-send-workers-who-are-well-to-hospitals-for?fbclid=IwAR3mg8r1ggqyCcfbkkZWk2EmE4F_dsMOHSlM0iEBVJ1BnmJ-Ez7Kaixn_Eg)

Now, I find this election has really brought up the good and bad of POFMA. In this respect, the ugly side of POFMA.",NEU

"I think the weirdest part of the POFMAs introduced during elections is that a PAP minister first calls the statement out to be ""False"" first, either via debate or press conference before the POFMA is issued.

In the 10 million debate, Vivian and HSK repeatedly alleged SDP to be false before the POFMA office came in.

Similarly in this case, the POFMAs were only issued after Lawrence Wong's press conference.

It's a bit disconcerting, because the determination of falsehood doesn't appear to be based on the statement itself, but rather the cue taken from the ministers. Its also perplexing that Thambyah is being POFMAed before Lim Tean?!?!?!?",NEG
"POFMA has to be wielded very judiciously for it to work. Once it loses credibility, it is as good as useless. 

I suspect the Ministers might not have wanted to apply it in this instance. But Perm Secs can be fumbling obsequious knobs sometimes.",NEG
"I just feel sad that this is happening to Dr Tambyah whose family has done so much for Singapore. His mother was an awarded pioneer social worker who set up special education schools, his grandfather was the first headmaster of St Andrews School and also saved local lives during the Japanese occupation. These may or may not make him parliamentary material but he certainly is not an enemy of the state as he is being painted out to be.",NEG
"Whatever it is, at that point of time tests were limited and it would be right to pritorize groups of people who needed it. At that time the dorm cluster was not discovered yet iirc",NEU

"If the power of POFMA is indeed necessary, it should be given to the courts, not the government.",NEU
"Points (1) and (2) are quite debatable. Point(3) is just Tambyah shooting himself in the foot, because there is no way he can prove that. 

If you have seen the emails that employers received regarding this issue, it is (in my interpretation) a bit grey whether whether MOM was against a)employers sending workers for tests or b) employers sending workers for tests en masse to abuse the system.  Some may interpret it as (a) and some may see it as (b). In this case which is the truth?",NEG
"Always look at the source - actual video on Youtube [NUSS Pre-General Election Forum 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35E4sohNUqI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=4075)

I am typing out what Dr Tambyah said in the video, and added in punctuation marks for clarity. This would of course, add in a certain degree of my own interpretation:

&gt;.. and what happened in February was we had a cluster of cases in Bangladeshi workers at the Seletar Aerospace construction site, and that was handled really well. They identified the contacts, they quarantined them, they set them apart, they tested a lot of people and then..  
&gt;  
&gt;Someone else (host? Didn't watch the entire video so I am not sure): that was in February?  
&gt;  
&gt;.. and then what happened was the employers started thinking - hey you know my workers are living in the same dormitory, maybe you should bring them for testing. **And then what happened was MOM issued a statement telling the employers they were not allowed to bring their workers for testing, and if they brought their workers for testing, they would lose their work pass privileges. They actively discouraged the testing.** And then in March, you know, all hell broke loose. You know we had the returning travellers..

The first statement in bold, if shown to someone in another country perhaps, would immediately mean that all workers, being sick or healthy are all not allowed to be tested. But this is not true, sick employees can obviously be tested. Hence actively discouraged testing becomes untrue as well.

Unfortunately we do not see the press release or statement from MOM, and do not get to see how exactly it was worded. I think it is only sent directly to employers? Do correct me if I am wrong.

I do not have the chance to listen to the New Naratif audio recording so far.

I think using POFMA against this on 5 Jul 2020 is justified, as this NUSS forum was held on 3 Jul 2020. Reason just simply because the 2 statements are incorrect and we see how much discussion it has already generated.

To add on, IMO why this has to be done - I have wrote in another [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hlnz76/pofma_office_instructed_to_issue_correction/fx0abfw/):

&gt; I think it has to be said that that was in Feb when the Seletar Aerospace Heights cluster happened. At that point in time testing capacity is still low and like a precious resource, should be duly allocated.  
&gt;  
&gt;Imagine the clusterf\*ck at NCID or TTSH A&amp;E if just 50 workers turn up in droves continuously. And compared to now, there were many infectious people waiting to be tested there then.  
&gt;  
&gt;If not controlled properly, it's a supercluster waiting to happen.  
&gt;  
&gt;I respect Dr Tambyah, but IMO this is why a full panel of doctors should also not be the way a task force sets up. And he should also understand why MOM issued that statement to prevent healthy workers from going directly to hospitals &amp; A&amp;Es asking for tests. One of the good things about Singapore is that it has a huge network of clinics, they should be fully made use of in this situation so as to lighten the workload of the hospitals.",NEU
"Rewriting history to say that something never happened. When the news came out in Feb, why didn’t MOM correct the media? It was true then and suddenly become untrue during election? And I think they are trying to find fault with exact use of words issit? But what Singaporeans want to know is what happened? And what can we do better? Why were employers discourage to proactively test their workers? Questions remain unanswered as POFMA is used to silence the queries.",NEG
"&gt;I just cannot find the source for the third statement if Dr Tambyah really said that.

In an interview with PJ Thum on 2 July (streamed on TOC's youtube channel), Paul Tambyah claimed that the Ministry of Health was [""blindsided""](https://youtu.be/mEBclG_1Uf8?t=3201) by MOM's advisory.

In the same interview, Paul also said the following:

[""when things started going south, you really needed the experts to come in and be able to overrule the Ministerial Committee""](https://youtu.be/mEBclG_1Uf8?t=3114).

[""The alternative should be getting the experts in, to determine how you prioritise these things. Rather than make it from a political policy decision based on the squeaky wheel - who makes the most noise and who gets the priority attention.""] (https://youtu.be/mEBclG_1Uf8?t=3223)

It's quite clear from the above that Paul was accusing the ministerial committee of not involving medical experts in the decision making process, and making decisions based on politics.",NEU
